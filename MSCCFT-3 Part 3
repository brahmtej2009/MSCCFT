14.1 INTRODUCTION
This Unit is to help you in the conduct of a family interview session.
Interviewing a family requires different understanding and additional skills
than when working with individuals. This Unit explains the difference and
gives you many examples of ways to do family therapy. The Unit is more
practical than theory.
Objectives:
After studying this Unit, you will be able to:
•. Enumerate features of family interviewing;
• Explain neutrality;
• Create a hypothesis of circular questions;
• Suggest an end of session message;
• Discuss issues of confidentiality; and
• Write up a family session record.
14.2 WHAT IS FAMILY INTERVIEWING?
The family therapist asks questions about the family system in order to
produce information that will reveal the patterns of family interaction, that
is, its systemic qualities. As the information is revealed the family becomes
aware of its manner of interactions. This creates a context within which the
family's capacity for change is stimulated. This questioning of the family
system is called family interviewing.
14.2.1 Evolution of FamH .aervlewlng
The interview as a way of procuring information is a relatively new
phenomenon. Though questioning and answering have always existed, not so
long ago, it would be strange to approach a stranger (let alone a family) and
discuss personal matters. Such conversations only happened with intimates.
Parents could ask children their whereabouts and the expectation was that
they got answers, not a dialogue in which the children were equal participants.
The democratization of opinion: The modern interview encounter is based
on new importance given to the individual as an integral member of a group,
including the family member (Benney and Hughes,1956). Individuals, including
children, are accepted as commentators of their own experience, able to offer
meaningful descriptions and opinions without the need to have an expert, or
authority figure to speak on their behalf.
14.2.2 Post-Modern Interviewing
Family therapy has been influenced by the social construction movement, in
~ that they remain open to multiple interpretations of any problem. There is no
one 'truth' - instead, a given situation can be viewed in many different ways,
depending on which viewpoint was being represented. In a family interview,
each member represents several viewpoints and in turn each of these m;'rnb(";
/
may have several voices (different aspects of themselves) with which they
speak. For example, a father concerned about his daughter's refusal to marry
comes for family therapy bringing his wife and daughter with him. He may
present himself and be seen as a concerned and conservative father. Other
aspects of him, a man who fears he has less power in the family compared
to his wife, a son-in-law who is less successful than his brothers-in-law, a
businessman who negotiates a hard bargain, a just employer, a lover of
classical music and animals but friendless, proud of his caste affiliations, all
of these 'voices' and more are contained within him.
"Family Interviewing
Which person is speaking when talking in the session? All of the people
present in the session, including the therapist. can speak of themselves in
-different ways and interact with each other 'wearing different hats' . In addition,
the context in which the session is taking place will have an impact on the
talking that happens. There is no 'correct' version, rather the therapist engages
multiple aspects of a person; of a family, of a situation.
The influence of post modem social construction OIl family therapy are given
below:
• There is no one truth; there are different versions. Therefore, all family
members' viewpoint is sought.
•. The therapist is not the expert; the clients are the expert on their situation.
Thus, therapist and clients work together to" solve problems.
• Concern about issues of representation - whose story is being told and
. what is "the function of this particular version of the story?
• Therapists own self awareness of how and why they are questioning or
intervening.
• Power relations are questioned, and ways to make unarticulated voices
. audible are a focus in family therapy.
14.2.3 Concept of 'Information' in Family Therapy
The main purpose of interviewing is to elicit new information. To understand
systemic family therapy the concept of information needs to be more clearly
defined than it is understood in daily life. Whenever information is exchanged,
a communication system is formed comprising of an interaction between a
'sender' and a 'receiver'. The amount of information that the behaviour or
.one interactional partner has for another depends on them having the same
'code' (perception, mind set, familiarity with the language of each other's
emotions) to interpret the communication. If one partner cannot perceive
the information being conveyed then the communication has not taken place,
or miscommunication has happened. When new information from one
interactional partner is sent but is received as 'not new' or of a familiar
pattern, it causes the 'receiver' to react in old ways, with no stimulus to
change. The amount of sent and received information in a statement can be
measured by how much the statement increases or reduces the possible
outcomes. The reaction to information depends on whether the interactional
partners recognise il difference as a difference. If so, 'information' can be
said to be created. Gregory Bateson (1979) defined information as 'any
difference that makes a difference, and brings change for the system'.
I
Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
In family therapy, the manner in which a family deals with information is a
decisive factor in diagnosis and therapy. The introduction of information into
a system (family or individual) has the potential of changing that system.
Rigid family systems ignore new information. For example, when a closed
family does not recognise the developmental context of their 15 year old's,
need for peer approval (new information but not received), they continue to
interact with him as if he was a much younger child ( old patterns of behaving).
Increasing frustration with the family's inability to acknowledge his age and
growing independence he runs away (new information, received). The family
is shocked into responding by making more flexible rules for his time spent
with friends (new information generates new possibilities). In turn the young
man appreciates that his family is caring towards him (more new information)
and promises not to run away.
14.2.4 Purpose of Family Interview
In family therapy, intervention is simultaneous with interviewing, that is, to
understand the system and to facilitate change are the purpose of each family
session. Tomm(l987) says that the 'the interview is a series of interventions' .
Following are the main purposes of family interview:
1. To provide information for therapist and for the family;
2. To facilitate the family's own healing;
3. To explore hypothesis that is, discarding, formulating new hypothesis,
adding to an existing hypothesis;
4. To use the session for intervening by reframing, highlighting dilemmas,
unbalancing; and
5. Noticing similarity and difference between different family members'
viewpoints regarding the problem in present, in the past, and what it
may be in the future.
2. What is the impact of new information on a family system?

1. What is the major influence of post-modem ideas on family therapy?
14.3 THE THERAPEUTIC INTERVIEW
The family interview is for the purpose of solving the family's problems.
Asking questions of family members is done for this purpose, and therefore,
questions are seen as interventions in the family system.
14.3.1 Questions as Interventions
According to Tomm and Lannamann (1988), in family therapy the' primary
intervention are the questions that the therapist poses to the family thus
opening up the conversation for the family members to examine their situation
from all viewpoints. In the grammatical form of questions there is something
that invites reflection and this creates possibilities for change, for something
new to happen. Even small changes in people's thinking or behaviour can
have profound change because it frees people from their habitual, stuck and
rigid ways. The therapist's questions are directed to help family members
generate greater flexibility and increased choices for themselves.
Everything that a therapist does is an intervention, so questions are not
randomly asked. All interventions have to be based on systemic hypothesis .
about the family and the symptom like: is the symptom a temporary response
to a perceived crisis, or does the symptom serve a function to keep the family
the same, or to bring about desired change? In selecting questions the criteria
for the therapist is to choose those that enhance the family's own ability to
find suitable solutions for their difficulties. Consider the consequences and
ramifications of an intervention for each member and for the system as a
whole before you make it. Observe their responses to your questions and to
each other's communication - verbal and non-verbal, analogic and digital. ~.
Feedback from each member and the family system should guide you
constantly.
There are many situations where these types of questions may serve to
challenge the family to explore new behaviours and beliefs. Remaining neutral
to their responses may be a key at times. If your hypothesis are on target,
their responses may indicate a lack of readiness for change, or that the
information was heard and once they have had time to think and talk about
it, they will figure out a way to work it out on their own.
14.3.2 Using Questions as Interventions
Ask questions of each family member which serves to challenge, inform, or
instruct indirectly; observe the family's response to these, questions or
challenges or reframes.
1. Use types of circular questions only after sufficient information has been
obtained from the family about their likely response and some working'
hypothesis have received adequate validation. Anticipate several responses.
2. Begin with questions which are least offensive or threatening, to test the
family's responses. ;;,'
For example .• with a family ,which appears comfortable with intimacy
and closeness, and yet neglects ~o demonstrate affection to each other,
ask each one how the others show family members (specific ones) that
they care for them. You may want to begin by comparing the members

3.
who seem closest to each other and, along the way, address the more
distant relationships. :
Ask questions which may prompt members to try out new behaviours,
like:·
i) Offering alternatives: Use some of their suggestions, and make up
a few others, including a desired response and possibly a paradox;
observe how they assess possibilities. For example: "What do you
think would help Harish (identified as withdrawn) learn to share his
feelings the most; for you 'to ask him questions about his day, for
you to share things about your lives with him, or for him to hear,
the two of you share your feelings with each other?". This type of
question or intervention allows members to evaluate alternatives.
ii) Preparing for transitions: These types of questions often encourage
families to discuss issues of transition from one life cycle stage to
another, and to prepare for this transition. For example, ask how
the older child is going to learn to live independently, and what
responsibilities she or he needs to acquire prior to moving out. This
intervention question may be used to test a hypothesis about
enmeshment, to expose a teenager's desire to move out or to remain
in the home, and to learn what preparations have been made, if any,
and who had discussed these plans.
iii) Embedded suggestions for the family: You may ask a type of
question in which a suggestion, indicating what would be good for
th'e'family, is embedded. For example, ask the children what activities
they enjoyed as a family over the -weekend; if the family has an
uninvolved parent, ask the children what they did with that parent
last week.
iv) Challenging a rigid system: Therapists may wish to challenge a
belief or family rule which seems to be rigid. Care must be taken
not to convey judgement but simply suggest other possibilities such
as, "What would happen if you were to offer to help your wife
take care of the children once a week?".
v) Embedding reframes and paradoxical interventions into
questions: Experiment with embedding reframes or paradoxes within
circular questions (if one is skilled in this manner of intervention):
"How did your son learn to be this creative? Who else in the family
" is creative (a positive connotation of "disobedient" and
"mischievous ")?; "What do you think your family would do if I
. told them that they are not ready for you to become independent,
and that you should rem3.in dependent upon them to help you with.
preparing for your college exams?" (paradox).
14.3.3 Guidelines for the _.Therapeutic Interview
There are mainly three guidelines for the therapeutic session (Selvini,
Boscolo,Cecchin & Prata, 1980). These are as follows:
Neutrality: This is a desired trait for the family therapist. No family member.
is given the opportunity to feel that she or he has a special relationship with
/
I
the therapist. The same degree of emotional closeness or distance is maintained
with each family member. It helps in preventing the therapist from being
drawn into family strategies that reduce the effectiveness of the therapist in
the face of stormy disturbing family events. The family therapist has empathy
in relating to the distress and pain and uses circular questions to talk with
the family rather than just reacting emotionally to one member's account.
Hypothesizing : This is ,the formulation by the therapist of a hypothesis
based on the information that is known about the family that is being
interviewed. It marks the starting point for the ideas that the .herapist has
and for the validation or discarding of these ideas. If the hypothesis are
incorrect then new ones are made based on the information acquired during
the testing of the first ones.
Circularity : This is the conducting of the session based on feedback
received from the family in response to the information that is asked about
relationships, differences and change. The term circularity or recursiveness or
circular causality are used interchangeably to denote a sequence of cause
apd effect that ,loops back to the cause and according to the feedback loop
can impact it to change. Cause and effect can be reversed in their impact on
the individual or family (in memory, family rituals) if not in time (time cannot
be reversed). For example, a family rule that was established in the past, is
applied to the present, and can be continued or modified in the future,
according to the feedback that the family system receives. The therapistasks
circular questions to elicit information that can be used as:
,I. Feedback to the therapist to formulate hypothesis; or
2. Feedback to the family to remain the same, or change.
Each of these three are described below in detail based on Nelson et al.
(1986).
Family Interviewing
• Neutrality
It is desirable that:
* The family sees the therapist as neutral:
1. As not taking sides with anyone member or subgroup,
n. As allied to everyone and to no one at the same time, and
m. As nonjudgemental and accepting of everyone.
* The therapist asks questions of each member:
i. Attempting to spend an equal amount of time with each, and
n. Qing around the circle, often with the same question or the same
type of question, to investigate each person's perceptions.
* The team or eo-therapist if present, assists in neutralizing any attempt
of a family member to form a special relationship or coalition with the
therapist.
,. Hypothesizing
Definition of hypothesizing: Hypothesizing can be _defined as thoughts,
ideas, suppositions, hunches, maps, explanations, or alternative explanations
about the family and the "problem" in its relational cont- L 11

Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
12
Purpose of hypothesis: Hypothesis serve the following objectives:
*
To make connections between family behaviours and their meaning,
* To guide the therapist' and help the therapist create -order and method
in the use of questions, and
*
To enable the members to develop new ideas of their relationships,
beliefs, and behaviours.
Formulation of hypothesis: Hypothesis are usually formed on the basis of
the following:
*
Based on information about the family (which is gathered during the
phone intake, from the referring person and subsequent sessions):
i) Descriptive opinions (from family members, referral sources, others),
ii) Behavioural observations (interactive 'patterns), and
iii) Verbal and non-verbal data (metaphors, cue words, repeated stories
and beliefs, myths, statements, expressions, secrets).
Based on previous experience and knowledge of the therapist:
i) About similar families (ethnicity, culture, religion),
ii) About similar problems, symptoms, and situations,
iii) About similar interactive patterns,
iv) About developmental and life cycle stages, and
I
1*
v) Of theory in general(systems, psychological, socio-political,
anthropological) .
Based on whatever may have bearing on the situation.
Keys and Guidelines: In the context of designing and testing hypothesis, it
is jmportant to:
1. Design hypothesis which are:
i) 'Useful: There are no }'right" hypothesis. The goal is not to identify
;'truth" , rather the goal is to generate the most useful' explanations '
of the family at that time ( 'useful' means that it is useful for
bringing positive change).
ii) Ultimately systemic: The hypothesis must include all components of
the family and its relational pattern.
iii) Related to the family's concerns: The hypothesis should address
most of the questions that are relevant to the family and the issues
at hand.
iv) Different from the family's hypothesis. The therapist's hypothesis
provide new information to the system.
2. Ask questions from each member, note responses to questions arid
interventions (to confirm or disconfirm hypotheses).
3. Discard unconfirmed hypotheses; modify useful hypotheses as new
information is provided hypotheses evolve.
I
4. Design interventions based on confirmed hypotheses or hypotheses which
seem most useful.
5. Do not tell the family about hypotheses, unless it is part of a planned
intervention .
• Circularity
Definition of the' circular interview: Circular interview is based on the
"capacity of the therapist to conduct her or his investigation on the basis of
feedback from the family in re.sponse to the information she or he solicits
about relationships, and therefore, about difference and change" (Palazzoli
Selvini et al., 1980, p. 8).
Purpose of circularity: Circularity serves the following objectives:
1. To i~troduce the family to a systemic view of itself by providing the
family members wit~ new information about their concerns, beliefs,
behaviours, and relationships,
2. To develop, confirm, or deny the therapist's hypothesis about the family
and the function of the problem, and
3. To intervene indirectly by raising issues neglected in the family (such as
expressing appreciation, allowing independence, helping a child learn a
desired trait through modeling) or by questioning the effectiveness of
attempted solutions to their situation.
Keys and guidelines: Think exclusively in terms of relationships and in
terms of differences or changes in behaviours between family members across
time. The following are the guidelines for conduucting a circular interview:
1. Ask questions of each member, not spending too much time with any
one person.
2. Ask about issues that are relevant to the problem or to your hypotheses.
3. Note the words or repeated phrases which the family members use to
describe the situation and each other's behaviour, such as "tense"
"nervous" "lazy," "good child" or "too much work". Use these words
in questions to ask about differences between people, their relationships
and behaviours; and investigate their explanations for these presumed
characteristics.
4. If there is labeling of a family member by other family members, reverse
the question and ask about the opposite; like, "Who was the first to
believe that Sameer was lazy?" becomes, "Who believes that Sameer is
not lazy?" or "When does Sameer work hard?".
5. Search for the missing links in a pattern of interactions so that the cycle
is complete. The missing information may be important to change
perception of the problem.
6. Do not ask a random assortment of questions without direction and
purpose.
7. Use linear questions sparingly, when inquiry can lead to important
information, then revert back to circular questioning.

14.4 PREPARATION FOR FIRST SESSION
14.4.1 Goals for the Session
The main goals of first interview are outlined below:
1. Diagnosis: The first interview has a special role in family therapy and
the major task is to formulate a hypothesis about the family dynamics.
The therapist tries out, validates or rejects hypothesis made prior to the
first session.
Hypothesizing prior to the session is based on information gathered
through the referral process and the information given by the referring
person or organisation.
2. Motivating: The therapist tries to understand the dynamics of the family
and introduces new perspectives in the first session, thereby increasing
the family's motivation to continue therapy.
3. Making a therapeutic contract: This can be as complex as determining
with the family the direction of change required, or as simple as deciding
to me~t at a regular interval and fixing the next appointment.
14.4.2 Preparing the Room
Before the session, the room should be prepared. Chairs should be placed in
a circle according to number of people attending. The therapist's chair should
be the same as the other chairs in the circle, and not be behind a desk. It
should be placed such that all the members attending can be seen and be able
to see each other. Extra chairs should be put to one side. If children are
attending, put out drawing material and a small selection of toys such as
dolls or animal figures for younger children. Avoid noisy toys that will distract
from the session or fragile ones that would break.

·""
14.4.3 Time for Each Session and Between Sessions Family Interviewing
Keep more than the traditional psychotherapy time of 50 minutes. The session
could go on for upto 90 minutes because everyone has to be given time to
speak. If working with a eo-therapist or a team, an extra 30 minutes should
be kept for hypothesizing prior to the arrival of the family and for reflecting
at the end of the session, after the family departs. It is the therapist's
responsibility to keep time. At the start of the session, talk about how much
time there is and ask how the family would like to use it. It is useful to mark
the half-way point, and to give another indication when 15 minutes are left,
that time is nearly up and that the session is to conclude soon. Be fIrm about
concluding, requesting the family to discuss last minute issues at the next
session. Sessions can be weekly, fortnightly or even monthly depending on
the family availability and the urgency of the problem being discussed.
Therapy can be brief or over a long time; depending on the nature of the
difficulty - if it is only the presenting problem or if the presenting problem
is one of many problems.
14.5 METHODS OF INTERVIEWING
."
Therapists and clients engage in special conversations that are for the purpose
of relieving mental pain and suffering. While talking to others, like friends
and family may serve the same purpose, the difference is that they are not
considered 'therapy' unless there is an agreement that one person assumes
the responsibility for guiding the conversation to be therapeutic for the other.
This special responsibility also confers special privileges of being able to
inquire into client's personal lives. The nature and manner of asking questions
must be sensitive to the potential for healing or causing further trauma.
In conversation, the therapist uses both statements and questions. Usually a
statement confirms or restates what has been said, for instance. 'Your divorce
has been painful to you'. A question on the other hand, will elicit information
on views, experiences and positions, for example, 'How does being divorced
change your life?'. Sometimes there is an overlap between a statement and
a question, for instance. 'You may be feeling shaky talking about this'. Under
certain situations it is better for therapists to provide answers instead of
asking clients to answer questions, for example when clients are unaware of
basic information or do not have the knowledge resources to answer
appropriately .
. Advantages of mainly asking questions during early and middle parts of a
session include the following:
1. Focus remains on the clients,
2. It motivates clients to engage in the conversation because questions setup the necessity of answering. When the' therapist also demonstrates her
or his commitment of listening by active listening skills, then dialogue
ensues.
15

and Fantily Therapy
3. Clients are stimulated to think about their difficulties in their own way.
Thus, asking questions rather than making statements fosters client
autonomy. When change takes place, the client's will feel a greater sense ,..
of achievement in their problem solving ability, instead of being dependent
on the expert knowledge of the therapist.
14.5.1 Different Types of Questions
Tomm (1988) has outlined four main types of questions that therapists can
ask, based on differences in-therapist intentions and therapist assumptions:
1. Lineal questions : When therapist assumes that events being talked
about in the session occur in a cause-and-effect manner, the questions
asked will be lineal. Examples, of lineal questions are: 'What is the
problem?', 'Who i.sdepressed'i; 'Since when?'. Such questions are useful
only in the beginning of the session to join with the family.
2. Circular questions: The therapist explores events in the session that are
recurrent, or recursive, and the questions used are circular. For example,
'Who else thinks that there is depression?', 'Who worries the most, and
who worries the least?'. Questions are asked to explore relationships.
3. Strategic questions: When the therapist believes that it is possible to
influence clients directly through.giving information, or giving instructions
then the questions that are used are strategic. For example, a therapist
asks, 'Can you see how the anger outburst could have been prevented
, by talking about it to your wife?'. The directiveness of the therapist to
influence the clients is indirect in the form of a question.
4. Reflexive questions : According to Tomm (1987), questions that the
family therapist asks members of a family that are designed to challenge
the family's or individual's construction of reality and views about a
relationship or event are reflexive questions. The therapist adopts a
facilitative stance and purposely asks those questions that generate new
ways to interpret old patterns of thought and behaviour. The questions
are meant to encourage members, to think about their existing belief
systems, and with reflection to develop constructive patterns of cognition
and behaviour. Clients are invited to see the context in which they had
formulated their problem from a different point of view. Examples of
reflexive questions are triadic questions, used by the Milan group , in
which a family member is asked to comment on the relationship of a
dyad (two persons in a relationship such as father-son), or a fourth
person is asked to comment on the relationship of a triad (three people
in a relationship such as mother and two children). Reflexive questions
include future oriented questions, hypothetical questions, embedded
suggestion questions, comparing with normal questions, distinctionclarifying questions, questions introducing hypothesis, therapy session
process questions, etc. All of these questions overlap with and are
incorporated in the section on circular questioning.

14.5.3 Circular Questions
Circular questions are classified into three main areas of inquiry or intervention,
which are as follows:
i) Problem definition questions,
ii) Sequence of interaction questions, and . -
iii) Comparision or classification questions.
Each of these are again sub-divided into questions asking about the time
.-frame, that is :
i) Present
ii) Past, and
iii) Future.
These are further sub-divided in order to explore each of the aspects given
below:
it Difference,
ii) Agreement or disagreement (between family members), and
iii) Explanation or meaning.
Let us discuss these three types of circular questions in detail.

-. Circular Questions: Sequence. of Interaction '"
Ask questions from each member about who does what, when (related to the
problem, symptom. or to your hypothesis)-: '

A. Ask for specific interactive behaviours:
1. Not in terms of personal character (for example, "When is he bad?",
but rather, "When does he act badly?" or "When does he show you
this behaviour?").
2. When members describe each other, have them elaborate with specific
examples of behaviours (for example, "What do the children do
when they are 'misbehaving'?" or, "Then what does uncle do that
shows you he is angry?").
B.. Ask about differences or changes:
1. In the past like, "How does what happens now differ from what
used to occur?".
2. In the future like, "How does this differ from what will happen
when she or he leaves home?".
3. In some hypothetical event such as, "What would happen if she or
he did this instead of that?"
This investigates the perceived consequences of change. Also use
hypothetical event questions to take power away from an individual
who uses threats of unwanted behaviours to manipulate the family
like, "What would happen if she or he ran away?" or "What would
Father or Mother do?"
C. Ask who agrees with whom about the sequence presented.
D. Ask for each member's explanation for certain member's behaviour
(around the problem). Ask what certain behaviours, responses, symptoms,
expressions, or suggestions mean to them and what they think these
behaviours mean to others. These questions serve to investigate
cognitions, values, rules, and myths about what is and what should be.
E. Attempt to discover the full cycle or sequence of behaviours between
members, which may interact recursively with the symptom,thereby
perpetuating it. An intervention may be designed to interrupt dysfunctional
patterns in the nuclear family and the extended family, the school, friends,
place of employment, the community, ethnic group, and so forth.
Examples of Sequence of Interaction Questions
These questions focus on interactional behaviours. A few examples of sequence
of interaction questions are given in (Table 14.3).

• Circular Questions: Comparison or Classification
•
Ask questions from each member about the other family members - about
their behaviours, beliefs, values, thoughts, traditions, habits, feelings, and
relationships:
A. Have members compare, contrast, and rank similarities and differences;
investigate inter-generational coalitions and alliances; watch for patterns.
Such an exploration of the problem encourages members to gossip in
the presence of the others (Penn, 1982; Palazzoli Selvini et aI., 1980).
This is also called triadic questioning - when a third person is asked to
comment on the behaviours and the relationship of two or more of the
others (Palazzoli Selvini et aI., 1980; Tomm, 1984b).
B. Investigate differences or changes in coalitions over time. Explore how
these changes may, be related to, the present dysfunction.
1. In the present and in the past; for example, "Has this always been
true?"
I
2. In the future, for example. "Who will be closest to Mother when
you have all grown up?".
3. In a hypothetical event; for example "Who would be closer to
Mother if Sister gets married?".
c. Ask who agrees or disagrees with whom, as this also provides information
about relationships (Penn, 1982; Palazzoli Selvini et aI., 1980).
D. Ask for their explanations of, or the meanings of, the coalitions and
patterns of relating in the family.

Some examples of comparison or classification questions are listed below:
=> "Who is most convinced that something is wrong with his behaviour?
Who next?"
=> "And whois least convinced that something is wro~g?" (Rank order)
=> "Classify the various members of the family in reference to their tendency
to keep their rooms neat. Begin with whoever is the neatest (or the
messiest)" .
=> If Mother begins to cry during the session, you may state: "Mother
seems unhappy. Who is most able to comfort her when she is sad - your
dad, your grandmother, your sister, or you? (Then who?)".

1. Give two advantages of using circular questions rather than linear
questions.
2. Name the three main types of circular questions and give an example
of each.
14.6 INTERVIEWING AN INDIVIDUAL CLIENT
The session may comprise a single person for part of the duration of the
therapy, or all of the sessions of the therapy. The systemic family therapy
essentials remain the same; to question the person in a way that releases new
information about relationships to the awareness of the person present in the
session. The therapist asks the client about relationships with family, and
other relevant persons, using circular questions based on hypothesis generated
from information given by the client The questions are formulated to help
the client to reflexively think about the emerging new information on the

interconnectedness between different parts of the client's system. Reflexive
thinking about one's role and activity and others', role and activity in that
system becomes the mechanism for change.
Family Interviewing
"
14.6.1 Bringing 'in Multiple Perspectives
Instead of bringing in multiple viewpoints by questioning members of a
family as in a family session, in an individual session family-members and
significant others are absent and.different viewpoints are brought into the
dyadic conversation between therapist and client by different ways. These are
. "
discussed below:
1. Through circular questions:
. .
• that bring in talk about people significant to the client, for example,
"What opinion would your fiance have on what you are saying
now?" or "What advise would your sister give me about how to
help you?" . v'.,.
• that bring in the internal 'voice' or 'idea' or 'force'. For example,
"When you felt like hitting him, but did not do so, whose internal
voice told you not to do it?" or "In what situations does your
internal voice prompt you to act destructive?".
The presentation of the 'third party' as an internal voice or idea that impacts
on the client as a force for positivity or negativity is employed in family
therapy. This technique is based on the building of a relational system between
the therapist, the client and the 'internal voice' or the force of an idea or
viewpoint. The therapist attempts to build a therapeutic alliance with the
client and against any such 'voices, forces or ideas' considered responsible
for the clients suffering or symptoms,
2. Through role play using empty chair technique, in which the client
speaks directly to the significant other represented as seated in an empty
chair. For example, "Suppose your father-in-law were sitting in that
.empty chair," what would you say to him?" or "if your habit of
procrastination were sitting in that empty chair, what would it say to
you?" The client can switch chairs, each chair representing a different
voice or viewpoint. Also the therapist' can enact a voice (internal or
external) and the client can respond. All these ways enable the client to
benefit from the experience of connecting with significant aspects of
themselves or from seeing significant relations from another point of
view. The role play ends with the therapist and client talking about their
experience and ideas arising from this.

14.6.2 Clients Suitable for Individual Systemic Therapy
Individual systemic therapy is suitable for following clients:
• Adolescents or young adults who have terminated family or couple
therapy and have resolved more or less the family conflicts but would
benefit from one-to-one sessions to deal with problems outside the family,
for example their identity and concerns about their future,
• Adolescents or young adults who refuse family therapy,
23

Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
~..
24
l
• Person who wants couples therapy but whose partner or spouse refuses
to attend; and
• Where family members or significant others refuse to attend, or cannot
attend due to physical or mental problems.
14.6.3 Therapist's Role in Working with Individual Clients:
Using Circularity
The therapist must give priority to listening to the client and listening for all
the client's external and internal 'voices' that the client has relationship with,
while listening to their own professional and personal 'voices' in their head
as they interact with the client.
When it is the therapist's tum to speak, the family therapist will microreframe, that is, the therapist offers a partial summary of what the client has
said, which includes the therapist's observations. For example, "You were
shocked to find out that your father too had failed once in school. You look
puzzled and perhaps troubled as you say that. I wonder if you believe that
there may be other things you may not know about your father?" Tht;._therapist
carefully observes the effect of this summarizing and reframing comment
which is asked like a question. The therapist can end the session with a
longer commentary, a macro-reframe that summarizes the information
emerging from the session and connects these elements so that it opens new
perspectives for the client. For example, "Today we have talked about family
history, particularly what is known and what is not and how these two
aspects of your family, telling and concealing, impact you. The family rule
appears 'to be to tell about success and to hide failure. You have followed the
same rule without knowing it. But now your wife expects you to share both
success and failure with her, for her it means emotional closeness. It's proving
a challenge to your ideas of closeness".
14.7 FORMULATING AN END-OF-SESSION
MESSAGE
As stated earlier, family therapists are continuously and simultaneously asking
questions, getting feedback and using feedback to intervene to open up
conversations to promote change during the session. At the end ofeach
session, several areas need to be addressed.
A more formal feedback is asked for from the family by the therapist; "Did
the session today connect you to possible ways to address your problems?"
"Is there something I should have asked but have overlooked?", "Is there
something else I should be looking at?" or "In today's meeting what surprised
you the most? The least?".
The therapist formulates an ending message for the family. This could be a
summary of the new information in the session focusing on closeness-distance,
talking-not talking, problem clarification, finding solutions or anything else
that is significant. It should always include an appreciation and
acknowledgement of the family's efforts to build bridges and find solutions.
The end message can reframe symptoms of the identified person or of the
problem so that the function of the symptom is seen as serving a useful

purpose for the family system. Pathologising, blaming and criticism should be
reframed positively. Deficits can be reframed as strengths.
If working with a eo-therapist or team, they are invited to offer their
observations to the family for the family to accept or discard as they think.
The observations are made in a supportive, tentative, nonjudgemental manner
offering hope and encouragement.
Other end-of-session interventions that can be made are as follows:
Family Interviewing
14.7.1 Prescriptive Message
The therapist prescribes the dynamics of the family that have resulted in
problems. This consists of a positive connotation of the family behaviour,
with a prescriptive statement to continue their behaviour.
For example: In a conflict-avoidant couple, the members are told that they
must 'continue to not fight at all, even if it results in not talking to each other
or withdrawing from each other's company. They must pretend that all is
well all the time. This will prevent any chance of a disagreement between
them.
14.7.2 Homework Tasks
Tasks are prescribed for the family to target specific problems in a time
frame. Tasks may be individual, reciprocal, or shared and can be conversation
tasks or activity tasks.
For example: Father and adult divorced daughter (who has returned to stay
with her parents after running her own home and career for 12 years) agreed
to the task o~jective of increasing independence by being together less and
respecting self-made decisions. The task called for actions such as not asking
or telling who the daughter was going out with and what she was spending
money on.
14.7.3 Prescribing a Therapeutic Ritual
Therapeutic ritual refers to a symbolic task used as an intervention. It has
multiple meanings for the family on several themes; healing, identity, belief,
celebration, membership, expression and negotiation. Tlte family must
determine the form and meaning of the ritual.
For example: A family that lost its father had not been permitted to attend
his funeral. After discussing it the family decided that they would have their
own farewell for him at home. They each would choose an object that most
represented him and bring it to the garden where that would ensemble and
share it with each other. They would finish by eating and drinking his favourite
foods. This enabled them to acknowledge their grief at his loss, and to feel
more connected to each other. .»
14.7.4 Therapeutic Paradox
Therapeutic paradox refers to another intervention' in which·the symptom is
prescribed so as to .create a benevolent context for positive change to take
place. The idea is that if the system is resistant to change, then removing any
expectation of change will neutralise the resistance. This is useful for families 25

"26 ji. ~,.
where problems have become chronic and there are many risks ,and dilemmas
involved in changing. Advising restraint, the therapist shows genuine respect
and concern that the pace of change is decided by the family.
For example: A therapist tells a family that presents itself as chronically
depressed, "What surprises me is that you are not more depressed than you
are now. Things have been so disappointing for you all. In fact, you might
be angry if you were not so depressed. But its possible that you are not ready
to be angry yet. If you were not depressed you would have to deal with your
extended family and your relationship with them. Since you are not ready for
being angry or dealing with family relationships, I think its important to
continue with your depression till such time that you can".

14.8 SPECIAL ISSUES IN CONDUCTING
FAMILY THERAPY , SESSIONS
14.8.1 Confidentiality Issues' with Couples and Families
As in~all therapy, information from family members and-the families' identity
must not be disclosed to anyone except to the supervisor. All notes, video
or camera recordings must be kept in a secure place. If information is stored
in a computer it must be accessible to authorized personnel only. If the·
therapist is,using the work with the family in a publication or a presehtation,
the full facts must be disclosed to the family and their consent taken before
proceeding. When consent is given, all efforts should be made to conceal the
family identity by changing names, location, age and other revealing data.
"
When working with couples"'or other family constellations, at the outset,
make an agreement with the clients about sharing or withholding of information
if talking to one or more members with one or more being absent from the
session. For example, if the husband attends a session alone, it is his
responsibility to ten his wife what transpired in the session, not the therapist's.
. ,.
I
In the next joint session, the therapist might start by asking if she has been
brought up-to-date by her spouse about the session. If she says she has not
been told, suggest that she ask her husband to tell her now, in the session.
If a family member has been absent, ask who will tell the missing person
about the session. This way the responsibility for communicating is the family's
and the therapist can stay out of their way, letting them build their relationship.
If a member tries to talk alone in order to tell you something private, discuss
the implications of this talking with the person and the family. It is better to
meet with all the people involved together. It avoids the trap of being
unwittingly being constrained by information about family secrets. Talking
about discussion, the family process of information sharing and of information
withholding should be discussed through circular questioning. This will reveal
the meaning of secrets for the family and the need that the family has to be
cautious, which can be dealt with safely.
14.8.2 Ethical Issues in Working with Children
It is unethical for the therapist to tell the family something that a family
member has confided in confidence without seeking and being granted
permission from that member. This is particularly tricky when dealing with
children. Legally the parents or the guardians hold rights to confidential
release of information such as school and doctor's records, so their permission
should be sought when the children are under 18 years. So, if you need to
speak to a child's teacher,ask the parents' permission before doing so. The
family therapist should also discuss in the first session the appropriate 'ground
rules' for confidentiality with the parents and child together. Adolescents
often ask for more confidentiality and it may be helpful to agree to that when
appropriate. Inappropriate promise of confidentiality would be in situation of
, life threatening situations or addictions or other situations that can be
dangerous.
Family Interviewing
14.8.3 Creating-a Safe and Respectful Environment for
Talking
A safe environment fo;' talking for all family memberthas to be created. By
taking a stance of seeking to understand, the family therapist demonstrates
respect of the family's struggles, atknowledging their efforts, expertise, and
their ability to heal themselves. When families feel that they retain control of
their family's process of problem solving and that no-one is judging or forcing
them to change in therapist determined ways, they feel safe.
>
.A child centered approach is advised for family work. involving children.
Sitting and talking. is not what young children do naturally. Be ready that
"children will play in the session and conversation will be inter-spread with
play. The pace Will be different and challenging but very useful in the amount
of family information that children possess. You should use language that
children can understand.
Therapists need to respect the family's rules of addressing each other and
being addressed. If two or more generations are in the session ask how they
prefer to be called by you, would grandfather like to be called what his
children call him, or by his first name or full name. Do the children like you
to use their pet names-or school names? Apologise' if you have inadvertently
caused offence by using the wrong form of address, particularly in working
cross-cn't-ira l1v.
- 27
Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy 14.8.4 Representing of All Points of View 1The silent member: The family therapist should hypothesise about the reason,
meaning and consequence of a family member's silence during sessions. Using
these hypothesis it maybe worthwhile to explore if the context of being in the
therapy session is the reason for the reluctance to speak. The silence should
be given a positive connotation (she or he wants to listen carefully) or
reframed as a helpful contribution to the family discussion. The child who is
prodded to speak by the parents feels judged and blamed. The therapist
should try to make the situation feel less threatening by discussing with the
young person how they could participate in the session if they wanted to, for
example they could write something that someone could read out, or draw
a drawing to show what their feeling was, or indicate with a gesture if they
wanted to Baysomething. The therapist could also ask another family member
to guess what the silent member would say and then ask the silent member
if they agreed or disagreed.
Too talkative member: The other extreme is the member who is too talkative,
and this tendency can be explored in its effect on the talking of other members-
"Who talks the most in your family?", "When father talks the most, are you
glad to listen or do you start daydreaming?".
Absent member: Discuss with the members present about any member who
is absent, for instance "What would she or he say about this viewpoint of
Y6li~s,if she or he were here?". Ask the family which member will tell the
absentee about the session. When the person rejoins the next session, ask if
they knoW what transpired in the session and who was the information giver.
Reluctant members: Reluctant members are those that indicate their
unwillihgness to attend - "We only came because we were sent". This is
worth exploring and will give information about whether the family is resistant
to change or if some members are more cautious than others.
Advice seekers: Advice seekers are those that say, "We want you to tell us .
what to do" and may say that they recognize your expertise. Go slow with
giving advice directly, until you understand the family patterns of change.

It may be done in several ways, such as:
• Case notes during sessions may be made, though this is difficult because
there is so much to observe that it is nearly impossible. Notes written
post the session should contain process and content of the session, any
new information gathered, which hypothesis were discarded, which were
developed further, and which new ones will be used to create questions
for further exploration. Which interventions were made and homework
tasks prescribed should be noted. A section on therapist self reflexivity
should include what meaning the session had for the therapist in personal
and professional domains.

Therapist self-reflexivity:
• The eo-therapist or reflecting team make notes of verbatim conversation
between therapist and family members including pauses and nonverbal
gestures or changing seats. This helps them to track interactional
sequences.
• The session is audio or video taped with the family's consent. Playback
is helpful for the family to become aware of its interactional patterns and
to correct distortions in their communication. This technique is useful
for training, supervision, for therapist self-monitoring and for treatment.
14.10 LET US SUM UP
In this Unit, we have learnt about the family interview and about interviewing
methods. The main point is that systemic family therapy pays a great deal of
attention to ways of introducing new information into the family system so
that change can happen. This new information emerges in circular questioning
when asking about past or present and future differences in problem definition, .
in agreements and disagreements, and in differences in meaning for each
member. Through the use of examples we can formulate these questions
based on hypothesis that are a result of information gathered, tried and
discarded or further developed. Neutrality is the stance that the therapist
takes in conducting the circular interview. At the end the therapist formulates

an ending message for the family to highlight similarities and differences and 1to encourage the system in its efforts to balance the forces of change and
the forces of stability.
14.11 GLOSSARY
Alliance A type of alignment in which two or more
family members join together to co-operate
on a task, often in opposition to another
member.
Coalition An alliance between specific members of a
family, sometimes against one member or
against a subsystem or across generations.
Dysfunctional pattern A situation in which a family responds to stress
with rigid, unyielding behaviour, rather than
flexibility. It is often the reason that brings a
family to therapy. For example, when a wife
asks for her husband to express more affection
and attention to her, he becomes more rigid,
distancing himself and communicating that, 'If
I give an inch, she will take a mile'.
Enmeshment A way of relating in which there is too much.
closeness and a lack of differentiation. The
boundaries between people are blurred, to the
extent that there is no autonomy, only an
exaggerated sense of belonging. A parent may
be so enmeshed with a child, even an adult
one, that the parent can speak for the child
and vice-versa. This affects other relationships
in a negative way.
Paradoxical intervention: A contradictory statement to the family that
overtly conveys a message that it should not
change; but is in fact made with the covert
purpose of encouraging change. It does not
arouse resistance in the system.
Recursive process' Description of a relationship in terms of other
relationships. The word recursive can be
substituted by reciprocal or circular. A husband
yells at his wife who yells back. Each influences
and is influenced by the other.
Reframlng or positive Re-labeling or redefining something to give it
connotation a more constructive perspective. Social
construction has made us aware of the process
by which we label feelings, thoughts,
behaviours and events and thus influence our
perception of reality. We can, and do, construct
our own reality, and thus can change it to
heal.
/

Unbalancing A technique used to change the rules (often
unstated) that govern relationships in the family,
particularly rules regarding hierarchy. Family
members, especially the less powerful or the
underdogs, are encouraged to take on new
and expanded roles and functions. This
provides new understanding to the family.

15.1 INTRODUCTION
We all have gone through some part of our lives having experienced crisis. It is
more serious than just having missed the bus, leaving the kitchen tap open with
the water running or having forgotten to pay the electricity bill. A crisis is much
more. The event is traumatic, immediate, typically unpredictable and overwhelming
for the person. There may be a drastic change in the person's environment. At
times, the event may involve threat to the very survival of the person. The usual
methods of coping or tackling the problem may not work leading to a period of
disorganization with no solution in sight. The person's state of being vulnerable
and helpless in such a situation may be termed as a 'crisis'. Interventicn by the
counsellor or therapist or helper is to restore the petson's equilibrium, and at the
33

same time, help the person perceive the world as a safe and secure place. Please
note that the term 'helper' is used in throughout this unit to describe the one who
'helps' the person in a crisis situation.
Why do I want to do crisis work?
Whether we are trained professionals or volunteers, the need to help and care for
others may be a motivation. Appropriate training is crucial and can determine how
effective our intervention is to a person, family or community facing a crisis.
There are different types of crisis: 1) developmental crises, are events which
occur in the normal course of time, for example birth of a child, change of job,
graduatiori from college or retirement, 2) situational crises, are unpredictable,
intense and sudden such as the loss of job, a sudden illness, death or loss of a
loved person, divorce or separation, financial problems or motor accidents; natural
disasters are included here (see Box 1), and 3) an existential crisis referring to
inner conflict which may raise questions in the person, for example at the age of
sixty, one may feel sad that one did not do much with life, or a bachelor of forty
years may feel a sense of anxiety that it may be too late to marry. Each crisis
situation is unique and different for each person. Box 1 given below reveals how
people view crisis differently.
Box 1
Survivors of an earthquake may have faded memories of the event but may be
faced with anxiety, panic or sleeplessness whenever there is noise or thunder
in the distance. Persons with HIV may cope with a strong psychosocial support
system but may abuse tobacco or alcohol whenever faced with depression as
the illness progresses. Another woman facing physical battering by her spouse
may be relieved to stay in a sheltered home but keeps worrying about facing
the future due to no financial means - this may lead to her choosing to return
to her abusive spouse.
Objectives:
After studying this Unit, you will be able to:
• Define and understand crisis;
,
• Learn how crisis develops and the role of precipitating factor;
• Understand steps in crisis management;
• Make an action plan for a person in crisis and evaluate the action; and
• Learn intervention strategies for crisis.
15.2 UNDERSTANDING CRISIS
In this section, you will learn about how crisis may be defined, understand crisis
as both danger and opportunity and identify common features of crises.
Crisis has many definitions.Let us understand how the following different definitions
broaden our understanding of crisis:
'\j1
• Crisis results from impediments to life goals that persons believe they cannot
overcome through usual choices and behaviours (Caplan cited in Gilliland
and James, 1993).
Crisis Intervention
• Crisis occurs because the individual knows no other response to deal with
a situation (Carkhuff & Berenson, cited in Gilliland and James, 1993).
• Crises are personal difficulties or situations that immobilise people; it prevents
them from consciously controlling their lives (Belkin, 1984 cited in Gilliland
and James, 1993).
• The term 'crisis' usually refers to a person's feeling of fear, shock and
distress about the disruption; but not the disruption itself (Brammer, 1985
cited in Gilliland and James, 1993).
From the above definitions, we can understand that crisis is a perception of an
event or situation as being intolerable and difficult; the person's resources and
coping mechanisms are also inadequate.
The common features seen when a person is facing a crisis situation are summarised
below:
• A triggering event perceived as threatening,
• Unexpected events,
• Person experiences discomfort causing fear, tension, confusion,
• Loss of daily routine,
• Failure of usual coping methods to reduce impact of stress,
• Uncertain future,
• Continuation of distress (about 2 to 6 weeks), and
• State of disequilibrium followed by rapid transition to an active state of crisis.
Crisis as Both Danger and Opportunity
It is important to keep in mind that there is an element of both danger and
opportunity in a crisis situation. Danger, as serious pathology may result in the
person. However, crisis is also an opportunity for self growth and empowerment
if the person overcomes it using personal resources or seeks help. The symptoms
of crisis are complicated as it affects a variety of areas for example workplace,
family, etc. As the situation gets progressively worse, there is a high risk of
disorganisation and psychological breakdown (see Box 2) which will be discussed
later in this Unit.
Vietnam veterans (USA) suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
proving that when there is a crisis and coping methods fail, disorganisation
occurs in the most tough individuals.
Box 2
Anxiety, discomfort and abuse of substances like alcohol and tobacco are common.
In many cases, intervention in the form of brief counselling is generally found to 35

be effective. Even though crisis and its after-effects on the person is time limited
(of six to eight weeks), there may be recurrence of crisis due to a series of new
problems which are unpredictable in nature. Long term therapeutic interventions
may be required in such cases. Crisis may originate from different factors and
people react differently to it.

15.3 UNDERSTANDING CRISIS
In this section you will study about the different origins of crisis, manifestations of
crisis, natural and formal crisis management. You will also learn the key principles
in crisis work.
The diagram (Fig l5.l) describes the interactional relationship between the origins
of crisis, how it manifests, management and its outcomes (Hoff, 1989). In India,
examples of crisis with origins situational in nature are the environmental disasters
that caused disruption in the lives of many people, for example, the earthquake
in Latur, Maharashtra or Tsunami in coastal Tamil Nadu etc. Pre-existing social
or cultural values that surround the person also determine the extent of the crisis,
for example origins on the basis of religion or faith led to riots in Ahmedabad in
Gujarat and Mangalore illKamataka. Examples of discrimination towards women
have social origins, for example harassment for dowry and domestic violence.

•
Following the crisis, the person may develop problems that are emotional, cognitive
and behavioural. There may also be physical problems, for example severe migraine,
chest pains, sleeplessness and abdominal pains. The person's normal functioning
in daily life is at threat.
Whatever the crisis may be, the person may manage the situation through the use
of local supports and resources leading to a successful resolution (termed as
managing naturally). This is possible for persons living in communities that have
inbuilt supports which are a part of the socio-cultural system. Remember, that
even if there are supports in the environment, the person in a crisis situation would
use them (to resolve the crisis) only if she or he perceives or views them as being

during classes in college. We can see that there is greater stress for the
family; but the crisis state is yet 'to occur. What will happen in Kumar's life
next?
Phase 3 : The person's anxiety level and tension rises further. Every resource
available is used to reduce the painful state of anxiety and solve the problem.
Unresolved problems and increasing tension can result in depression.
Kumar's doctor counsels him and provides emotional support. He arranges
for ~ome nursing care at home. Rani decid~s to work to.support the family'
and starts teaching at the local tutorial college. Sita's college teacher has
been counselling her and advises her to apply for a. scholarship to' help
paying of the college fees. A crisis has been prevented by using multiple
resources.
Phase 4 : The active state of crisis occurs in this phase. Poor social supports and
lack of inner strength could compound the problem causing more tension and
anxiety. It can result in a psychological breakdown.
However, Kumar and Rani have been able to respond to his. unexpected
illness using available help. A full blown crisis has been avoided by taking'
various decisions and actions during the preceding phases.
Now, let us look at the same situation.differently :
• Kumarmay feel completely helpless after hearing about his illness;
•. He has no support system or resources; he is unable to cope and'use
problem solving methods; and
• Tension and anxiety levels rise ill"Kumar and the family as a whole.
• A state of active crisis occurs.
The above case illustrates that despite the interplay of various difficult situatione,
the person including the family as a whole averts a crisis..
15.5.4 Outcome of Persons in a State of Crisis
Remember, a person cannot stay in a crisis state forever and indefinitely. As the :
process of being in this state is top painful, the person attempts to return to a level
of stability that existed before the event. There are different outcomes after a crisis
situation in a person's life. They are summarized below:
1. A person could return to her or his pre-crisis state and usual state of
being. Various problem solving methods, inner values and external SoCial
supports play an important role in this. There may be no new insight or
growth in the affected person.
2. Some can grow from the crisis experience and discover new resources
and ways of solving problems. Using the resources is empowering for the
person and family. There is personal growth. • , ..
3. There are others who may lapse into behaviour that is pathological and .,
destructive (depression, psychosis, suspiciousness, and developing
addictions). Committing suicide may also occur.

15.4.5 Crisis, Acute Stress Disorder and Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder
Crisis Intervention
Acute Stress Reactions (ASR) occur after traumatic events. If these reactions
continue beyond a month, the person is diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). These diagnostic categories appear in DSM IV and ICD 10
Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders (World Health Organisation,
1992).Remember, most crises can develop into traumas and most traumas begin
as crisis. It is difficult to differentiate between these categories as the symptoms
are similar. Let us understand the Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) and Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)'
The person can have acute stress disorder (ASD) when she or he has been
exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present:
1. The person experienced, witnessed or was confronted with an event or
events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or a threat
to the physical integrity of self or others.
2. The person's responses involved intense fear, helplessness or horror.
Either while experiencing or after experiencing the distressing event, the individual
has three (or more) of the following dissociative symptoms:
1. A subjective sense of numbing, detachment or absence of emotional
responsiveness;
2. A reduction in awareness of her or his surroundings;
3. Derealisation;
4. Depersonalisation; and
5. Dissociative amnesia (unable to recall aspects of trauma).
The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced in at least one of the following
ways - recurrent images, thoughts, dreams, illusions, flashback episodes, a sense
of reliving the experience or distress on exposure to reminders of the traumatic
event. There is marked avoidance of stimuli that arouse recollections of the trauma
(for example, thoughts, feelings, conversations, activities, places and people), and
marked symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal (for example, difficulty sleeping,
irritability, poor concentration, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and
motor restlessness). ASD leads to impairment in social, occupational or important
areas of functioning or impairs the ability to pursue some necessary task or
mobilise personal resources. Disturbance lasts for a minimum of two days to a
maximum of four weeks and occurs within four weeks of the traumatic event. The
disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (for
example, a drug abuse, medication) or a general medical condition.
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
PTSD may occur in a person who has been exposed to trauma in which both of
the following were present:

11. The person experienced, witnessed or was confronted with an event that
.. involved actual or threatened death or serious injury or threat to physical
integrity of self or others, and
2. The person's response involved intense fear, helplessness or horror.
The traumatic event is persistently re-experienced in one or more ways:
1. Recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event including images,
thoughts and perceptions;
2.' Recurrent distressing dreams of the event;
3. Acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring;
4. Intense psychological distress on exposure to internal or external cues that
symbolise or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event; and
5. Physiological reactivity on exposure to internal or external cues that symbolise
an aspect of the traumatic event.
There is persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and the numbing
of general responsiveness (not present before the trauma), as indicated by three
(or more) of the following:
1. Efforts to avoid activities, places, people associated with the trauma;
2. Inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma;
3. Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities;
4. Feelings of detachment from others;
5. Restricted range of affect; and
6. Sense of foreshortened future.
One finds persistent symptoms of increased arousal (two or more of the following):
1. Difficulty in sleeping,
2. Irritability,
3. Difficulty in concentrating, '
4. Hypervigilance, and
5. Exaggerated startle response.
Duration of PTSD is at least one month. The disturbance causes clinically significant
distress or impairment in social,occupational or other important areas of functioning.
What we need to keep in mind or what is most important to us as a helper is that,
a crisis is distinguished from a stress reaction or trauma on the basis of how
quickly it is resolved. The social and cultural background of the person, emotional
support and type of crisis will dictate how soon the person can resolve the
problem and return to normal life. Hence, intervention has to be immediate to
prevent the person from developing more serious problems.
There are many ways of managing a crisis. The next section presents the steps
to be considered when making an intervention plan and how we could prevent
the situation from worsening.

15.5 BASIC STEPS OF CRISIS MANAGEMENT
In this section, we will learn about psychosocial assessment, making a plan, and
evaluating the action plan. We will also discuss myths about the persons in crisis
situations.
We have understood that crisis resolution by individuals occurs with or without
the help of others in settingsthat are natural (in homes, communities) or institutional
(hospitals,rehabilitation centres). People who go through crisis usually use available
resources to avoid negative outcomes (termed natural crisis management).
When help is received from professionals or institution, it is known asformal
crisis management, for example, community health workers, doctors, nurses,
teachers in the local school, police and mental health professionals. It is likely that
most of us may neither have had previous experience nor training in this area and
may have plans to do so in future. In such a case, it is important to consult with
'. those who are trained and familiar with crisis work for guidance and supervision
(that is, from experienced counsellors, mental health professionals including trained
crisis workers).
The following sub sections present the basic steps of crisis management (Gilliland
& lames, 1993):
15.5.1 Psychosocial Assessment
Psychosocial assessment is done at two levels:
1. At the first level, you need to check if there is a threat to the life of the
person in crisis; or for others. Suicidal thoughts or ideas can mean a risk to self,
/
Crisis Intervention
43

Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
44
whereas risks of assault and homicide mean a threat to others for example,
children, spouse, other family members, neighbours or helpers. IBox 4: A case of attempted suicide
Sunita, aged 28 years is shocked to read her medical report stating that
she is HIV positive. She is unable to accept the news and is also filled
with shame and guilt. She starts thinking about ending her life. A few
days later, she attempts suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping tablets.
Her sister finds her lying unconscious and immediately rushes her to the
local clinic. Sun ita does not wish to speak to anyone at the clinic. The
helper is requested to see her.
Guidelines During Assessment (Case of Risk of Suicide): Assess the person's
reason for living or dying; what motivates her or him to die or what are the
contributing social factors? What is the degree of planning involved? What is the
method of ending her or his life, how lethal is it? Is the person safe once she or
he is at home? Is she or he abusing any drugs or is she or he depressed? How
long has she er he been having suicidal thoughts? Final acts in the form of leaving
a note, making a will or distributing personal possessions to others are warning
signs that the risk of suicide is high.
When there is a risk of suicide (as seen in the above case), or of assault and
homicide, you need to consult a specialist (psychiatrist) and refer the person.
2. At the second level, check if the person functions in the usual role or is the
person in danger of being excluded from her or his natural setting? For this, a
more comprehensive assessment is done like: '
• You need to identify the origin of crisis;
• To what extent has the crisis developed? Is it acute? Is the person in the
early stage or in a transition state of turmoil?;
• How is the crisis manifested in the person? For this, we need to explore the
emotional, cognitive and behaviour aspects in the person;
• How is the person coping with the situation? List local resources to help the
person; for example, does the person have a familyand others that offer,
support?; and
• Are there cultural factors in the environment that contribute to the crisis?
Assessment of the event or situation: Understanding the hazardous event
including precipitating factors in the right context is important (see Box 5). Through
questioning, identifying various eventsincluding failure of the usual coping methods
that pushed the person to a state of crisis can be a challenge. Providing help and
intervention in the early stages can help the person prevent the crisis situation from
worsenmg.
Box 5
Ask a direct question like 'could you state what happened?' Remember, the
person may be in a state of shock or too upset to answer your questions.
Simple questions may be used, for example, "What time did it happen?
What were you doing?': The way you question may help the person to
put things in a sequence and can calm the individual; for example, many of
them may say they ar~ going crazy or their life is out of control.
jj~1
Assessment of feelings: The person's subjective responses to questions in
order to probe feelings show how vulnerable the person is (see Box 6). In a
crisis situation, high levels of anxiety can lead to negative results. A sense of
dread, fear of losing control and emptiness, threat of losing one's material
possessions or social relationships, anger towards self or others, shame that one
is unable to manage life, a sense of shock and lack of focus are commonly
reported. Physical symptoms may accompany such feelings, for example, sweating,
feeling like vomiting, increased heart beat, chest pain, headaches, stomach pain,
skin rashes and sexual disinterest. The person may send distress signals to others
when they experience crisisthrough use of unhealthy coping methods (like excessive
drinking of alcohol or abuse of drugs, getting into lawbreaking activities and
suicidal attempts).

I can see that you are very upset - would you like to talk abour'it?
Assessment of thoughts, perceptions and behaviour: The state of confusion
faced in the person can affect normal decision making ability. The person may be
unable to understand and make sense of the events happening around her or him.
Where behaviour is concerned, a person may not be able to perform normal
activities. Remember, such disturbances should not be considered as a mental
Illness as the person usually returns to normalcy once the crisis is tackled.
Remember, what a crisis means for one person may not be so for another. Each
person will react differently. An understanding of feelings will help us to make a
specially tailored plan to decide the methods of intervention.
15.5.2 Making a Plan with the Person
Planning goals for a person facing a crisis comprise:
• Helping the person to return to a pre-crisis state,
• Strengthening the person with the use of problems solving skills, and
• Prevention of negative outcomes.
Let us study the excerpt of the case given below (in Box 7) to understand how
the initial interview helps in making a plan.
Helper:
Ravi:
Tell me what happened? (Crisis assessment begins).
I had a motor cycle accident today .... (Angrily) Can't you see me
with cuts and wounds? (Person is distressed, crisis is to be
identified).
Helper: I can see that you are badly hurt. The doctor also said you were
driving on the wrong side of the road. Can you tell me more?
(Probing questions).
Box 7
Ravi, about 52 years old, is seen by a helper volunteering at the local hospital.
He has been seen by the duty doctor who cleaned his wounds. He had injuries
caused by an accident while riding his motor cycle.

Ravi: Well, I was tired. So I lost my concentration while on the road and
hit the road divider. I have not been sleeping well recently
(Active crisis state- person is very anxious and has physical
symptoms).
Helper: Uh huh..(Helper encouraging Ravi using non verbal methods).
Ravi: I have also been having severe chest pain in the past (Physical
illness identified) .... I heard last month that I may lose my job as
my friend Ashok told me about this. After all, I have been working
for 20 years in the same company. Today, I go to work and I get
a letter from my boss confmning it (Precipitating factor is hearing
about loss of job).
Helper: I see... (she leans forward showing more interest).
Ravi: My wife doesnot know about this. I have not told her yet. All these
thoughts made me lose my concentration when I was riding my bike
to return home. I lost control (Vulnerable state - feels loss of
external support, unable to communicate with wife and use her
support; hazardous event is the accident).
Helper: The sudden news of you losing your job has greatly disturbed you.
It has caused you a lot of worry, tiredness, poor sleep and now chest
pain. It distracted you and made you lose control of your bike on
the road. Am I right? (Helper checking if she has understood the
problem correctly).
Ravi: Yes. I don't know what I am going to do. I cannot face my family.
What will I do for an income? I have two children studying in college
(Active crisis state: Person is vulnerable, feels he has not lived
up to his role as main breadwinner).
Helper: You feel helpless and desperate about the situation. How long have
you been feeling this way?
Ravi: Since past 2 or 3 weeks, when I heard rumours about the job loss
at office (Precipitating factor is evident for current crisis situation).
Helper: Have you talked to anyone about this?
Ravi: There was no one I could talk to. I sometimes thought of going to
my family doctor to get some pain killers for my chest pain. But then
no one can help me out of this situation (inability to use outside
resources; feeling helpless, alone, confused).
Helper: You felt there was no one who could help you. Is that right?
Ravi: Yes.
Helper: Ravi, if you like to discuss some ways to deal with your job loss we
could meet at the counselling centre (Helper is checking if Ravi
would like to take help for the problem).
Ravi: I don't know what to do. I really feel my life is hopeless. But I can
l
listen to what you have to offer (Ravi acknowledges his state of
hopelessness and expresses willingness to take help).
Helper: Ok. There are several things we can discuss. .
--------------------------
What Crisis Intervention does the above interview between the Helper and Ravi illustrate
to us?
• Helper asks direct, simple questions during assessment of the crisis,
• Helper is understanding; acknowledges Ravi's feelings (sense of helplessness,
hopelessness, anxiety),
• Ravi's health problems are associated with the precipitating event (poor
concentration: sleeplessness following news of job loss),
• The precipitating factor leads to the hazardous event (accident),
• Resources available but unused by Ravi (for example, wife, doctor, friend),
• Lack of effective coping by Ravi during the crisis,
• Helper offers some concrete help (counselling intervention), and
• Ravi feels that the helper is concerned and is willing to consider her help.
Once the person is identified as being in a state of crisis, the planning process
begins. A good plan made by helper contains arrangements for immediate help to
restore the person to normalcy. This is the same for persons in an emergency
situation (due to a suicide attempt or death of a loved one). Remember, the
distressed person should feel that she or he is heard or understood. For example,
the helper has used statements that are reflective of his feelings such as "You seem
helpless". When the helper is not sure if she has understood Ravi, she clarifies -
"Is that right?" Or "Could you tell me what happened?".
Ravi could also be asked to rate the problems he considers as most urgent, for
example, "Which problem seems most important to you that you would like to
work on?"; What do you think troubles you the most now?"or "Whom would
you like to be involved to help you tackle this problem?". This way, Ravi is
actively involved in decision making.
Note: A good understanding about listening skills will help you to work
effectively in crisis management.
Following are some questions for a more detailed assessment in the later sessions:
• How much has the crisis disrupted Ravi's normal life?
• How has the crisis disrupted life in other family members?
• Is the person feeling suicidal or depressed? How high is the tension and
anxiety felt by Ravi? How severe are his health related problems?
• Does Ravi have a support system (family, friends, and community)? What
are the available resources and how can they be used?
• Will Ravi be able to find a new job?
• To what extent can the helper offer support to Ravi?
The next stage is about putting the plan into action.
15.5.3 Putting the Action Plan to Work
A plan is arrived at mutually, that is, after both helper and person in crisis have
worked on together. We should keep in mind that even though a person is in
crisis, she or he is able to make decisions and is essentially still in charge of her
47
I
Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
48
or his own life. The active involvement can be empowering for her or him. The
helper together with the person in crisis needs to discuss options that are reasonable
and appropriate to the client's life situation. Goals and expectations are clearly
discussed and prioritised.
Remember to keep in mind the local cultural context when working on the action
plan, We may unknowingly impose our values and customs on a person who may
be from a different background, for example. religion, ethnic group, urban or rural
area. Coping with death, mourning, physical illness, marriages etc. may vary
across cultures.
The plan includes significant others in the person's surrounding environment, that
is the person's closest family members and friends should be included. Remember,
the person may be unable to recognize them as being supportive and there could
beloss of contact with them. In many cases, the person's closest contact may
be hostile and contribute to the crisis. We have to consider as to whether the
family is part of the problem or the solution. Finding newer ways of helping the
person would be the next step.
Some common myths that need to be considered at the time of planning are
presented below (in Box 8):
Box 8: Some myths about persons in a crisis state
Myth: Persons in a crisis state are helpless.
Fact: Persons may be denied the opportunity to help themselves in a crisis
state. This may be due to the saviour tactics or rescuing tendencies by
helpers - it can result in burnout for them and be damaging for others. The
need to recognise each person's self determination, capability to grow and
sense of control is important.
Myth: People in crisis suffer from a form of mental illness.
Fact: It is important to distinguish between the crisis state a person is in and
various forms of mental illness. People in crisis are basically normaL Some
who are acutely upset or in a crisis may have had emotional or mental
disturbances before the crisis; or the unsuccessful attempts to tackle the
problem may have resulted in a breakdown leading to a state of high tension
and anxiety. Remember, for some persons, hospitalisation itself can be a
hazardous event: I could not stand the hospital's smelL
Myth: Only psychiatrists or highly trained therapists can help those
. . .
in a cnS1S.
Fact: Plenty of work has been effectively done by volunteers, police officers,
nurses, teachers, clergy or priests, community workers etc. They often work
in crisis intervention in the absence of mental health professionals.
I Myth: Crisis intervention is a mere 'band aid' or temporary fix.
I Fact: More and more mental health professionals recognise the effectiveness
I ~nd economy of crisis intervention in helping distressed people. It is not
~onsidered as trivial or an ineffective practice, -
15.5.4 Evaluating the Action Plan for Crisis Resolution
A good action plan should have both follow up and evaluation. While evaluating
the action plan, check if the following points are included in the action plan:
1
• Overall plan is mutually developed: If the goals in the plan have been
made by the helper alone, they may not be of much value for the person in
crisis. Remember, the process of decision making recognises growth and
development in the person and fits into the person's culture.
• The plan should be flexible: The ongoing changes in the person's life need
to be considered, that is, the original plan should be uniquely tailored to suit
each individual. Keep in mind possible changes from previously set goals.
.• Focus on the immediate issue: For example, the precipitating factor may
be the loss of job. Hence, the plan should address issues surrounding the job
loss and not the individual's underlying personality factors (this could be a
long term goal).
• Concrete time and use of resources: Specific time and days to meet
'should be stated. For example, "You have agreed to meet me for our sessions
at the Centre on Wednesdays and Saturdays at Spm". This would help the
person gain confidence, reduce confusion and strengthen feelings that she or
he is in control of her or his life again and that certain resources (like helper,
centre or hospital) are available and dependable.
• Anticipated end in the plan: For example, action A is planned for week
one, action B for second week and so on. This could be reassuring and a
change from the chaos and crisis experience. An evaluation of the plan and
outcome at different points of time could be done.
• When the helper takes an active role in planning: Often, the person in
crisis is unable to take independent decisions and may face a temporary loss
of functioning (excessive anxiety or depression). In such a case, the helper
can step in to put a plan together till the acute crisis phase is over. This
occurs after careful assessment of the person's capabilities. Remember, the
helper's role is to inspire confidence and restore independence in the person
in crisis. Hence, the helper encourages a healthy state of interdependence;
not dependence on the helper or on others. The helper also knows when to
terminate so that the person is once again in charge of her or his life.
• Finally, a good plan has a follow-up: If follow-up is excluded in the plan,
it may be difficult to monitor the changes (positive and negative). The helper
would not be able to evaluate and sustain the work achieved by the person
•
in crisis.Hence, dates, time of meeting, place etc. have to be fixed in advance.

15.6 INTERVENTION STRATEGIES
This section will acquant you with the knowledge of working through loss and
grief, and stages of reactions to loss. Effective listening and verbal and non verbal
skills'Oflistening are two important techniques in crisis intervention. We will study
these techniques in this section. Specific interventions go hand in hand with the
action plan. Effective listening skillshelp individuals experiencing intense emotional
reactions at the time of crisis.
15.6.1 Working through Loss and Grief
The crisis intervention process includes grief work for a person in whom loss is
the central issue. Humans are attached to other human beings and have relationships
in various areas, that is friends, family, pets, place where they live, country, status
in the family or society, homes, loss of job, freedom, good health etc.
Loss of any of the above causes grief and emotional pain and the tendency is to
avoid coming to terms with the situation. Hence, grief is a process of suffering
when the bereaved person has to face a new life without the person, object or
lost status. Before recovery, the person can experience symptoms that are both
psychological and physical (crying, short of breath, intense anger, chest pain and
sleeplessness).
The stages of reactions to loss are given below:
• Denial and avoidance 'Ofthe memory of the lost object,
• Reactions such as anxiety, sleeplessness, sadness, preoccupation with
thoughts about loss obstructs normal activity,
• Anger towards loss and others,
• Guilt due to perceived neglect by self or others on object of loss (person
may feel guilty about having survived - termed 'death guilt'), and
• Attempting to recreate the lost object (for example; building lost homes).
The goals for the person going through grief would be as follows: acceptance of
pain and loss; .understanding that intense feelings are normal and part of loss;
allowing open expression (feelings of sadness, guilt, anger as per rituals and
customs) and enabling new patterns of living using local supports. In certain
societies, care of the person going through grief is seen as a collective responsibility
(commonly seenin many communities in the Indian context). Remember, in the 4
absence of any support systems, the above reactions may be excessive, prolonged
and may lead to more serious problems. Assisting the person from preventing
and developing pathological outcomes due to grief is.important in crisis work.
15.6.2 Effective Listening
Effective listening assists the helper to build trust and establish rapport with the
person. The person may be anxious, too afraid to talk or may feel that the
problem is too small to be upset about. The person may also have bottled up
feelings such as anger, hurt, hopelessness or sadness. When the person speaks,
attention is paid by using verbal and non verbal methods (head nodding, comments
such as 'go on', 'hmmm' etc). Use of listening skills can release pent-up emotions
in the person (see Box 9 for listening skills).
Box 9 : Listening skills
Eye contact, body posture, tone of voice, warmth, empathy and genuineness
are important during the counselling session. Use of open and closed questions,
reflection of feelings, clarifying and summarising are skills used with the
person in crisis.
The listening process helps the person to reflect and gain a better understanding
of the entire situation, for example, there may be self blame by the person like
"Why was our house attacked by the mob?"; or "Why did I get cancer when I
am so health conscious?': Thoughtful reflection by the helper can help the person
to change negative perception of themselves (for example, self- pity or anger) and
accept reality. Some may feel that they are 'victims' or 'survivors'. Channeling
negative emotions through action can bring about change.
The act of listening can bring back previous problem solving methods that may
have been given up or simply disrupted by the person. The helper enables the
person to re-use personal resources, learn healthier coping and newer responses.
Social networks and supportive cultural rituals can be restored.
Remember, effective listening can save time and prevent further escalation of the
problem. Lengthy hospitalisation, medicines and rehabilitation can also be avoided.
The action plan should (as far as possible) be set in the person's natural setting
or community.

15.7 FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CRISIS
We will study about families and communities in crisis in this section.
15.7.1 Families in a Crisis Situation
Like individuals, there can also be families as a unit facing crisis. Some families . .
may be very good at coping and using problem solving methods; others may be
less successful due to fewer or even absence of resources or the poor use of
them. Hospitalisation of a family member (due to illness or accident), death,
marital problems, financial and job loss, suicide (besides what has been mentioned
in this unit as contributing to crisis in an individual) can affect the family as a
whole. Today, nuclear families in urban areas may be able to get more support
from friends (referred to as 'New age' families). This is unlike traditional nuclear
families where the support system may have been from a smaller group (parents,
children, relatives). Remember, the family can play a dual role, that is, it may
be the origin of a crisis or it may be a support to those in crisis.
15.7.2 Communities Affected by Crisis
Crisis can affect communities living in small villages and large cities. Social and
economic problems where basic needs are unmet (religious conflicts, caste, lack
of housing, slums, poverty, poor access to water, education, health care); and
natural disasters (floods, tsunamis, droughts, earthquakes) can be sources of
crisis. Disruption of normal functioning due to any of these can create tension and
fear. Lack of resources can lead to poor coping by the community. Traumatic
events can also mobilise and strengthen communities. Management of crisis
would be similar to the methods used for individuals.
In conclusion, we can see that crisis are universal and usually brief. Intervention
strategiesshould be structured,brief and capable of bringing small changes sufficient
to solve problems. In most cases, the helper may have a single session with the
person. The tapping of the person's strengths and abilities are central to a positive
result. Seeing the person resume control after their lives have been shattered, can
be a satisfying experience for helper.

15.8 LET US SUM UP
Crisis Intervention
In this Unit, we have learnt about the crisis and how does it develop. We learnt
that crisis is both danger as well opportunity. Further, we studied about the
different origins of crisis and its manifestations. The Unit explained the natural and
formal methods of crisis managment. It also discussed, the key principles in crisis
work. Period of impact, a period of recoil, and a post traumatic period are the
different stages of development of crisis. We have also studied the role of
precipitating factors. The Unit aquainted you with the knowledge on acute stress
disorder (ASD) and post traumatic stress disorder (PfSD). Pychosocial assessment,
making a plan, putting action plan to work, and evaluating the action plan are four
steps of managing a crisis. Making and evaluating of action plan includes several
points, that are, overall plan sho~ld be mutually developed, the plan should be
flexible, focus on the immediate issues, concrete time and use of resources,
anticipated end in the plan, when the helper takes active role in planning, and a
follow-up. We have also studied myths related to persons in crisis, in this Unit.
We have learnt about the intervention strategies that are working through loss and
grief, effective listening, and verbal and non-verbal skills of listening. In the end
of the Unit, we have studied about the families and communities in crisis.

16.1 INTRODUCTION
The term "supportive counselling" has many different meanings. Supportive
counselling often takes place after the initial stressful situation has subsided
and the client perceives a need for additional emotional support. It is a form
of psychologi.cal treatment given to clients with chronic and disabling
psychiatric condi.tions for whom fundamental change is not a realistic goal.
These people !ll"eoften severely handicapped, with a limited range of interest
and activities, and less interaction with the social world. They are often
isolated and have conflicting relationships. Their ability to cope with the
everyday challenges of life is limited and they have few social and other
resources to assist them. The counselling is given by trained mental health
professional but is also applied by, among others, general practitioners and
social workers. .

Objectives
After studying this Unit, you will be able to:
• Understand supportive counselling;
• Learn aims of supportive counselling;
• Explain counsellor-client relationship in a typical counselling session;
• Describe characteristics of the counsellor and techniques of counselling;
and
• Discuss the problems in supportive counselling.
16.2 DEFINITION OF SUPPORTIVE
COUNSELLING
Supportive counselling can be defined as a form of psychological treatment
provided to a patient over an extended period, often years, in order to sustain
her or him psychologically, because she or he is unable to manage her or his
life adequately without this long term help. An alternative definition states it
as a form of long term counselling that aims to optimise patients' functioning,
promote their autonomy, enhance their self-esteem and lessen their anxiety
and distress.
Supportive counselling should be "trauma specific". This means that the
counselling should only address the immediate problem and any consequences
and issues that arise in i.2,:" aftermath of that trauma. Keeping the counselling
relationship focused on the trauma helps ensure that the client - with support
- confronts the crisis reaction she or he experienced and begins the process
of reconstructing their life. This is not to say that pre-existing life problems
will be ignored. Rather, once the trauma-specific support has been initiated,
the counsellor will be better able to assist the client to resolve other problems
in a descending order of priority. For example, a domestic violence victim
should be provided emotional support to help cope with current violent
incident(s). Then, when the immediate crisis situation has been alleviated
somewhat, the counsellor can begin to explore with the victim other concerns
she may have. •
16.3 AIMS OF SUPPORTIVE COUNSELLING
The aims of supportive counselling can be summarised as follows:
1. To promote the client's best possible psychological and social adaptation
by restoring and reinforcing her or his abilities to cope with the challenges
of life,
2. To bolster client's self esteem and self confidence as much as possible
by highlighting assets and achievements,
3. To make client aware of the reality of her or his life situation; for
example, of her or his own limitations and those of treatment-of what
can and cannot be achieved,
4. To enable the client to require only that degree of professional support
which will result in her or his best possible adaptation, and so prevent
undue dependency, and
5. To transfer the source of support (not necessarily all of it) from
professionals to relatives or friends, provided the latter are available and
in a position, psychologically and materially, to assume the role of
caregiver,

16.4 THE COUNSELLOR-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP
The typical client for whom supportive counselling is indicated experiences
difficulty in maintaining relationships with others, both intimate and general.
Thus, the relationship between client and counsellor in supportive counselling
is of particular kind, that is the counsellor assumes a helping role, attends
sensitively to the client's needs through various strategies but promotes only
a modest level of closeness (Crown, 1988).
Apart from the issue of closeness, the other feature that typifies the counsellorclient relationship is the directive role the counsellor plays. He assumes a
measure of responsibility-not seen in other forms of psychotherapy, because
the client is chronically impaired and vulnerable, unable to live autonomously.
To an extent the bond resembles that between parent and child, that is, the
counsellor or therapist creates and maintains a link through which she or he
offers the security and care the client needs (Winnicott 1965; Meyer 1993).
16.5 CHARACTERISTICS OF COUNSELLOR
Counselling is a process whereby a qualified person purposefully assists another
person to better handle her or his problems. Counselling is not just giving
advice. It's mutual trust and understanding. Counselling is a skill gained
through knowledge and practice of time-tested fundamentals or traits. A
competent counsellor should display sincerity, good listening skills, and
integrity to successfully assist people in gaining a better understanding of
themselves and their problems. A good counsellor will have a number of key
characteristics as mentioned below:
• Holding and Containment
The ability of the counsellor to be there for the person provides a point of
stability and security in her or his otherwise chaotic world. The comfort

when they are under stress. Often in counselling, the best intervention is to
listen and do nothing rather than to do something that is ineffective or even
destructive. On the other hand, it is important to recognise when a
dysfunctional, though stable situation has changed and requires active'
intervention.
• Genuineness
The role of the counsellor in supportive counselling is to be a model for the
client. Some minimal self-disclosure may be appropriate instead of discussing
specific aspects of her or his life or personal problems. For example, counsellor
can share a joke and tell patient that her or his life is not as perfect and ideal
as she or he ass ernes.
• Reassurance
Reassurance is another key characteristic of a good counsellor. It is used
more frequently in supportive counselling than in most other forms of therapy.
The counsellor reassures clients in at least two ways, that is, by removing
doubts and misconceptions, and by pointing to their assets. Clients commonly
have thoughts or sentiments about themselves which are ill founded and lead
to considerable distress. Reassurance can be used to relieve fears in the client
that she or he is crazy or becoming so, that she or he has a serious physical
illness, or that her or his symptoms are unique to her or him alone etc.
• Explanation
An ability to explain to the person and the family about her or his illness is
an essential characteristic of a counsellor. People with severe disorders may
, have distorted perceptions of reality that adversely affect their j~rlQemf'nt and
behaviour. Clarification and explanation of the reality of a situation will help
them meet challenges in more adaptive ways. For example a woman with
depression and her family members are explained about the illness, its
symptoms, causes, treatment and prognosis.
• Advice
Advice is given more frequently in supportive counselling because of the
person's limited coping skills than in other forms of therapies. Advice is
given about treatment of the illness and when and how to seek help; about
every day problems such as budgeting, diet, good sleep habit and general
self-care; and on social and interpersonal skills, for example, being assertive
or how to behave on social' occasions.
• Suggestion
A good counsellor must posses the ability to give Ijght suggestion to her or
his client. Similar to guidance, the person is offered less choice in considering
whether to comply. The counsellor aims to induce change by influencing her
or him implicitly or explicitly. An example of implicit influence is the counsellor
manifesting approval of desirable behaviour like, "The way you stood up for
yourself was terrific", with the obvious implication that the person ought to
replicate the behaviour,
• Encouragement
By making encouraging statements about a person's actions, a good counsellor
can enhance a person's self esteem, reduce her or his sense of ineffectiveness
and promote further positive actions. Like reassurance, encouragement must
be genuine and realistic if it is to be beneficial. It is important to stay alert
to the possibility of change and progress. Clients must be encouraged to take
small steps so that the chance of negotiating them successfully is increased.
Each mastery experience then promotes self-confidence and serves as a source
of encouragement for subsequent initiatives.

16.6 TECHNIQUES OF SUPPORTIVE
COUNSELLING
A number of techniques are employed in supportive counselling. Basic
interview skills are required, which include history taking, listening, clarifying,
allowing the expression of feelings, asking directive psychological questions,
using an empathetic style and responding to verbal and nonverbal cues. Most
important is the ability to listen to the client, to clarify what she or he says,
and to be alert to' any significant change, whether for better or for worse.
The following techniques are used as a part of supportive counselling:
16.6.1 Maximise Adaptive Coping Mechanisms
An important technique is to increase a person's coping skills and use of
adaptive defense mechanisms. Adaptive defense mechanisms include
intellectualisation, rationalisation, humor, anticipation, altruism, and
-sublimation. In contrast, the more maladaptive defense mechanisms include
denial, splitting, projection and acting out. The supportive counsellor's goal
is not only to increase the use of the former but also to decrease use of the
latter. Whether one uses the term coping mechanisms or defense mechanisms,
the process involved is one of healthy adjustment by the client to current
stressors. Examples might include going for a walk, calling a friend, immersing
oneself in work, applying relaxation techniques, speaking with a counsellor
and so forth ..
The supportive counsellor can enhance a person's coping skills through
educating about problem, and repeated practice of specific mechanisms for
dealing with stressful situations.
16.6.2 Focus on the Here and Now
Here and now issues should be the primary focus of supportive counselling.
How is the client feeling? How is the client getting along at work, with
family, with friends? Is the person able to pay the rent? Does she or he have
difficulty finding transportation to and from work? Is the person having any
medication? It is through these everyday details that the counsellor has
sufficient data to judge how the client is doing and what should be the focus
of their work together, Once current mood and symptoms as wen as logistical
issues concerning rent, transportation, medication and the like have been
satisfactorily reviewed or addressed, the here and now focus should concentrate
on a crucial area for most psychologically impaired persons, like, interpersonal
relations and social skills. The more the counsellor can help a client to
increase her or his interpersonal skills; awareness and reality testing as well
as develop appropriate social skills, the better the person will function in
everyday existence.
16.6.3 Provide a Role Model for' Identification
The supportive counsellor as role model cannot and more importantly should
not present herself or himself as a perfect human being. Not only is the
counsellor far from perfect, but there is much the client can learn from the
counsellor's mistakes and failures as well as from successes. Indeed, it is
often of great benefit to the client to learn (either through counsellor's selfdisclosure of past events or through direct observation of the counsellor in
,

the office) how the counsellor handles anger, irritation, confusion,
disappointment, embarrassment, and failure - the vicissitudes of life that
confront everyone, whether mentally ill or psychologically healthy.
16.6.4 Raise Self-Esteem
Many different approaches (for example, self-talk correction of cognitive
distortions or unraveling of unconscious guilt) may be taken in order to
accomplish this goal. Nevertheless, perhaps the most direct and often the
most robust means of raising self-esteem is by fostering an individual's
competency in real skills. Indeed, there is nothing more effective in helping
a client feel better about her or him than the actual demonstration to self and
others that she or he is truly competent.
A number of tactics are useful in promoting an individual's competence or
mastery. Perhaps the most important are taking one step at a time and
working to set a patient up for success rather than failure. In other words,
the counsellor guides' the client through individual steps and manipulates the
variables to increase the likelihood of success at each step. For example, a
female patient has been unable to obtain a job for several years. Rather than
simply sending her on a job interview with the hope that she will be successful,
the counsellor may engage in behavioural rehearsal with the client. Through
role play, the client may alleviate some of her anxiety, and together she and
the counsellor can solve the problem and potential difficulties. The client and
counsellor may agree to engage in "practice interview" with family members
where one of the active, confident members of the family may take the role
of an employer and through role plays she or he can help the person to
I .
prepare for future interviews for desirable jobs.
16.6.5 Effecting Changes in the Client's Environment
Stressful factors need to be carefully assessed so that they can be suitably
modified. Environmental changes of a more positive kind are as important
as the removal of stress. Thus, encouraging the client to participate in social
activities can be of considerable value. Social contact is enhanced but in ::
protective way. People who are close to client, like family members are
included in the treatment. The supportive counsellor may attempt to maximise
family support by working with key family members. The counsellor assisting
relatives or friends can use many of the strategies we have already discussed
including guidance, encouragement and reassurance.
Failure of supportive counselling of the chronically ill person may well be
due to the counsellor's neglect of the family's needs. She or he may have
overlooked or underestimated the marked positive effects on the client's
welfare that can result when optimising the family'S role as ally. The family's
successful incorporation however requires that they be fully informed and
counselled, and then instructed as to what to do and how to do it. In
addition, family members need help in their own right to care for their
relative as the process can be burdensome and frustrating.

16.6.6 Interpreting Defenses
Though the interpretation of defenses does not play a major role in supportive
counselling, there are times when it is useful to clarify how a person feels,
and to discuss maladaptive ways in which she or he responds to events. A
useful technique is to ask a client to reflect back on how she or he reacted
to a stressful event, after the event has passed and she or he is calm.
16.6.7 Catharsis
Within a trusting therapeutic relationship, a person may be able to reveal
events in their lives that they have been unable to discuss with anyone else.
The counsellor, by showing that she or he is a sympathetic, active listener
who accepts the client unconditionally, grants her or him permission to share
her "Orhis secrets. Although sharing of emotionally charged material is not
necessarily effective in itself (Yalon et aI., 1977), the process leads to a sense
of relief and serves as a vehicle for other strategies.
Other methods usually used in supportive counselling are relaxation training,
social, skills training, attendance at a social club,' and occupational therapy.
Treating the person together with spouse or family may be indicated but the
approach adopted is primarily supportive rather than dissecting the nature of
intra-familial relationships. The counsellor uses the strategies discussed above
to help the family cope more effectively as a group.

2. What are the strategies used for enhancing a person's self-esteem?
16.7 PRACTICE OF SUPPORTIVE
COUNSELLING
Supportive counselling seeks to help the client establish a unique pathway to
reconstruction or healing. Every client will find her or his own way in
reconstructing a new life. Just as the problem is experienced in a common
but unique fashion, so must the reconstruction process be unique but common.
,
During the counselling process, counsellor should be non-judgemental,
supportive and open in their response to decisions. There are pathways that
would generally be considered negative as clients try to reconstruct a future
like substance abuse, suicide, destruction of relationships etc. Counsellors
should be prepared to deal with ethical issues and to refer clients for
appropriate mental health counselling when necessary.
One tool used in the counselling process is education. Education is invariably
a large and important part of supportive counselling. Information on coping
strategies for dealing with both problems and long term stress reactions is
useful. Positive strategies, such as cultivating a support system of family and
friends, relaxation exercises, or physical exercise should be stressed. Negative
strategies, such as substance abuse, excessive sleep, or excessive activity,
should be outlined so that choices may be made to avoid them.
Clients need practical education regarding their problems. Using
understandable, non-technical language and employing sensitivity to what the
client can and cannot tolerate hearing at a given time, the counsellor tries to
help the person learn about her or his illness (for example, depression). The
illness's symptoms, course, and prognosis are discussed. Armed with
knowledge of participants and warning symptoms specific for a particular
illness in her or his particular case, the client can take steps to prevent
psychological breakdown. Throughout the continuing process of such
education, it is important that supportive counsellor preserves hope in the
client, balancing the reality of the client's circumstances with appropriate
optimism for the future. There may be great benefit if client's family, significant
others, key friends, or employer are educated. Such persons can serve, if they
are willing and able, as additional "observing egos" for the client.
Timing of practical information is important. In immediate crisis situation,
such information may be ignored. After a few days and through supportive
counselling, most information will be welcomed. Problem solving exercises
can be used in the session in order to enhance the expertise of the client. For
example, give the client a scenario relating to the problem he or she is
currently facing. Ask him or her to define the most critical issues facing
individuals in that scenario. After they are defined, ask him or her to develop
a strategy of action to deal with such issues, including' a time-line for
completing action tasks. She or he can report back on a regular basis the
efforts made to accomplish the tasks and the problems confronted in reaching
the goals.
Another tool of counsellor is encouraging clients to establish a healthy routine.
This is easier said than done, since many clients don't care about their health,
at least, not now..However, family members can be encouraged to take care
of their diet as most client assistance providers know that a healthy regime
will help anyone to cope better with life's stress.
It is crucial that the supportive counsellor help the client to become active,
to "do" rather than simply "say" or "talk about". Whether in the office with
the counsellor or in the everyday world, the client is encouraged to experiment
with new ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. It is also helpful to have
the client set concrete, achievable behavioural goals. "I want to be happy"
or "I want to be a better person" are legitimate goals, but they are so broad'
as to be difficult to operationalise. In addition, such general goals make
Supportive Counselling
65

Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
66
assessment of progress difficult, often resulting in the client experiencing a
sense of "going nowhere". Thus, "I want to be a better person" might be
concretised into specific behavioural objectives as follows: "I want to apologise
to my family when I become unreasonably angry with them, and I want to
return telephone calls from friends within 24 hours."
Family members can play an important role in providing support to the client
for fulfilling her or his goals. Specific concrete behavioural goals may be set
by family members. For instance, they can help client through all steps involved
in the process of obtaining a job; selecting the right job, constructing a
resume, choosing the right clothes, practice appropriate manners, coherently
describing occupational goals, responding to difficult questions and following
up on the interview.
Another tool for the supportive counsellor is to help clients overcome their
sense of estrangement and isolation from the world through some type of
.social integration. One factor in reconstructing social integration may be a
reconnection with family members. Family members and friends may be
involved in the counselling process and help can be sought for improving
social relationship. Thus, family as a support system can be extremely valuable.
Another factor in developing social integration is the potential of support in
the work place or at school. Workplace support can be as useful as family
support. More time is spent by many individuals with fellow employees or
other students than it is in the family circle. But pre-existing tensions of the
workplace may exacerbate the problem, and the demands of the workplace
may also mean that stress is expressed and normal work is emphasised.
An option for the counsellor in generating social support is to offer clients
an opportunity to participate in peer support groups. They provide people in
similar circumstances with an opportunity to describe their experiences with
the emotional aftermath of stress and effective coping strategies. The focus
in the groups is on the confrontation and acknowledgement of grief, crisis
and trauma for support for efforts to reconstruct new lives.
In a counselling session, the essence of supportive counselling is to help
clients learn to cope through awareness, acceptance and understanding of
their reactions. Clients may not be able to define those reactions so the
supportive counsellor can help provide options of names and words that will
help describe the sensations. Helping the client revisit the trauma or event is
a part of supportive counselling.
Often, one of the most powerful supports a counsellor can give to client is
to provide them materials and ideas that will help them construct a new sense
of meaning in the world. That meaning may be found in a new relationship
with God. It may be found in a love for humanity. The search for meaning,
for some, is inextricably connected with trying to change things, so that the
tragedy cannot be repeated in the future. Activism is often an antidote to
depression and a constructive way of expressing anger.
16.8 PROBLEMS IN SUPPORTIVE
COUNSELLING
There are certain limitations in the application of supportive counselling.
How actively to intervene; when and how much to self disclose; deciding

whether or not a reassuring statement is true; how comprehensive an
explanation should be; whether to ignore or confront a person's denial; when
to give advice; what is appropriate encouragement; how actively to embark
on a plan of rehabilitation; deciding the appropriate goals of rehabilitation,
when it is useful to promote an emotional catharsis versus when-to move on;
and deciding whether an intervention is for the sake of the client or to satisfy
an impulse of your own are issues that a counsellor constantly needs to
grapple with. It is difficult to strike the right balance between providing
support to the person while not promoting excessive dependence. The main
limitations of supportive counselling are:
• Some degree of dependency is inevitable. On the other hand, excessive
reliance on counsellor's; guidance may cause the person to regress and
act in less adaptive ways. An excessively directive approach may reinforce
a person's feelings of helplessness and further compromise her or his
ability to act autonomously.
• Since the people who are offered supportive counselling often have
great difficulty in personal relationships, maintaining a therapeutic alliance
with these people is often difficult.
• Moreover, the limited gains made overlong periods of time can be
.demoralising and frustrating for the counsellor. It is essential to monitor
counter transference to prevent acting out in the counselling.
• Counsellor in supportive counselling reveals more of herself or himself
to the client, at times even providing some minimal self disclosure. It is
a constant challenge deciding what, when and how much to self-disclose.
Counsellor should be more careful not to blur the professional boundaries
between counsellor and client. A failure to clarify the boundaries will
confuse the person and may lead her or him to make excessive demands.

16.9 LET US SUM UP
In this Unit, we have learnt about supportive counselling, its goals, strategies
used and how to use it in practice. In supportive counselling, the counsellor
simply aims to be a good listener and provide emotional support. Supportive
counselling aims' not to change, but rather to strengthen client's coping
mechanism. The overall aim is to optimise the client's adaptation to living.
Specific aims are to optimise their social and occupational functioning, to
help them deal as adaptively as possible with life challenges, to acknowledge
and cope with their losses, to boost their self-esteem, to improve their reality
testing, to monitor their mental states and prevent relapse of their illnesses,
to support their families and other carers, to provide a source of comfort and
security, to promote their autonomy and eventually to transfer support from
counselling on to the individual's family and other people in their social
milieu.
The techniques used in supportive counselling are maximising coping skills,
raising self esteem, focussing on here and now, interpreting defenses, improving
social support and catharsis.

17.1 INTRODUCTION
Psychoeducation is considered to be an inherent part of treatment regime in
the modem era. Understanding the lack of awareness in patients and their
families about the various disorders, it is important that well trained
professionals educate them in a structured manner. This information would
enable the suffering families to deal with the disorder effectively. According
to Swaminathan et al. (2009), today's patients and caregivers want to
completely understand the illness and, therefore, desire to know everything
about it and its treatment. Writers of the modem times believe that intentional
suppression of crucial information violates a patient's rights and is against the
ethics of the treating physician. Patient education is imperative to improve
compliance and outcome. After appropriate education one expects the patients 71
I
Modalities of Counselling
and Family Therapy
72
and their families to develop a fundamental understanding of the therapy and
be prepared and committed for long-term involvement with the treatment
process. Psychoeducation is an important tool that aims to empower the
patient with information with a solid scientific basis, improves their confidence
in themselves and in the treatment they are undergoing. It, thus, promotes
the development of trust in their clinician.
Objectives
After studying this Unit, you will be able to:
• Define the concept of psychoeducation;
• Elaborate on the goal psychoeducation;
• Describe the history of psychoeducation;
• Understand the structure of psychoeducational sessions;
• Elaborate on the broad areas addressed in any psychoeducational
programme; and
• Discuss family psychoeducation.
17.2.1 Defining Psychoeducation
Psychoeducation is defined as "systematic, structured, didactic information
on the illness and its treatment which includes integrating emotional aspects
in order to enable the participants - patients as well as family members -
to cope with the illness" (Bauml et. al., 2003).
When considered from the perspective of psychotherapy, psychoeducation
refers to the components of treatment where active communication of
information, exchange of information among those afflicted, and treatment of
general aspects of the illness is the primary aim.
17.2.2 What is Not Considered to be Psychoeducation?
Having understood the above definition, one must be in a position to exclude
several interventions which might have been mistaken for psychoeducation.
For example: "Pure psychotherapeutic groups are not considered
psychoeducation; similarly inpatient groups where everyday routine activities
are discussed, concentration groups, muscle relaxation groups or newspaper
groups are not considered psychoeducation; routine information dialogues
between patients or family members and the treating physician or psychologist
are also not considered psychoeducation" (Bauml et al., 2003).
17.2.3 Goal of psycho education
The most important goal of all therapeutic interventions lies in empowering
the individuals affected as well as their families. For the patients to be able
to tackle their illness as best as possible, it is crucial that they develop a basic
understanding of the disorder they are afflicted with, its background and the
treatment options which are currently available. Without the differential
understanding of the illness, there may not be requisite insight, compliance
and improvement in coping, long-term and successful cooperation with
professionals. taking care of them and their families.
Preliminary briefing must, in every case, be carried out by a cautious and
empathic therapist, in order to do away with the dysfunctional beliefs and
attitudes of the patients and their families as also to help them understand
/

that sufficient research has been earned out on the subject and help is readily
,available to them. This would help them feel secure and remain hopeful.
Brochures, books, and videos can be introduced ina supportive' function
when it comes to providing evidence for the professional' s assertions about
the disorder and also for future reference. The employment of various forms
of media can provide further support and facilitate understanding.

17.3 HOW DID PSYCHOEDUCATION COME
ABOUT?
The term "psychoeducation" was first employed by Anderson et al. and was
used to describe a behavioural therapeutic concept consisting of four elements;
that are, briefing the patients about their illness, problem solving training,
communication training, and self-assertiveness training, whereby relatives were
also included.
Within the Anglo-American realm, psychoeducation was viewed as a
combination of several therapeutic elements contained within a complex
psychosocial intervention than an independent, self-contained therapeutic
method. Thus, psychoeducation was originally conceived as a composite of
numerous therapeutic elements within a complex family therapy intervention.
Patients and their relatives were, by means of preliminary briefing concerning
the illness, supposed to develop a fundamental understanding of the therapy
and further be convinced to commit to more long-term, involvement. Since
the mid 1980s, psychoeducation has evolved into an independent therapeutic
programme with a focus-en the didactically 'sldllful communication of key

information within the framework of a cognitive-behavioural approach.
Through this, patients and their relatives should be empowered to understand
and accept the illness and cope with it in a successful manner. The underlying
aim was to create a well-defined, manualised, and curriculum-oriented
therapeutic method, adapted to fit the needs of patients with schizophrenia.
Since then it has been extended to create awareness about other mental
illnesses .as well.

programme?
17.4 WHO DOES PSYCHOEDUCATION?
Most of the moderators of psychoeducational groups are psychologists,
psychiatrists, physicians, counsellors, and family therapists. "Additional staff'
for the initiation of psychoeducational groups is considered necessary in
those institutions which do not offer psychoeducation. It, therefore, appears
necessary to integrate more moderators into psychoeducation than there are
today. On the one hand, this can be done by integrating the entire psychiatric
team, that is, psychiatrists, psychologists, and especially the nursing staff and
social workers, into psychoeducation (Kissling et al, 2003; Liberman et al
2001; Corrigan, et. al., 2001). For greater effectiveness, in fact, one needs
trained cadres of counsellors and family therapists. Apart from the aforesaid,
individuals from educational backgrounds such as Child Development, Human
Development, Human Development and Family Studies, who have chosen to
specialise as counsellors and / or family therapists, are suitable for performing
the role of psychoeducation. Another approach to improving the availability
of moderators for psychoeducation is the "peer-to-peer concept', in which
recovered patients who are personally experienced with schizophrenia or
their family members are trained to become group moderators themselves.
17.5 STRUCTURE OF PSYCHOEDUCA:T()~AL
SESSIONS
Most institutions conduct psychoeducation according to the published
recommendations, for example, regarding informational and emotional
contents, moderators, participants, duration, or frequency of sessions. These

include: patient psychoeducation, that is, up to 10 participants meet once a
week for 50 to 60 minutes for 8 to 12 sessions, moderated by two moderators;
family psychoeducation is conducted every two weeks for 6 to 15 participants
for duration of 90 minutes with a mean number of 7 sessions per group.
Psychoeducation
17.5.1 Broad Areas Addressed in Any Psychoeducational
Programme
The main informational topics addressed, for example, while dealing with
psychiatric disorders are warning signs, course and duration of illness,
causation, vulnerability-stress model, contingency plan, pharmacotherapy,
psychotherapy, relapse prevention, role of family and education in treatment,
impact of illness, and resources available. Emotional topics frequently dealt
with are stigmatisation, isolation, feelings of guilt and shame, monetary as in

17.6 FAMILY PSYCHOEDUCATION
Family psychoeducation has become a strongly supported evidence-based
practice in the treatment of schizophrenia (McFarlane et al, 2003; MurraySwank Ab et aI, 2004; Pitschel-Walz et al, 2001). Involving families in the
treatment process ensures continued therapeutic support to the individual
with the disorder even at times when professional help may not be available.
It is with adequate understanding of the disorder by the family that most of
the goals of treatment in psychiatric disorders are achieved as a number of
factors in the family, vis-a-vis, the individual may be contributing to or
maintaining the illness.
Any successful psychoeducation programme involves family needs assessment,
the encouragement of peer support between participants, and adequate staff
training as well as on-going supervision. Gidron et al. indicated that educational
and supportive group participation of families who are caring for a relative
with severe mental illness enhances the knowledge of the illness, its treatment
and mental health services as needed, and encourages the utilisation of the
social resources available and the employment of more frequently active and
interactive help-seeking coping strategies. Norton et al., on the other hand,
found that family support groups provided guidance on how to establish
better relationships with relatives with severe and enduring mental illness and
how to negotiate more effectively with the mental health system. Overall,
family education is known to lower relapse rates in people with schizophrenia

As we can see, literature supports the view that psychoeducation in families
of patients with mental illness, say, schizophrenia can reduce the relapse
rates of these patients (McFarlane et al., 1995; Hogarty et al., 1991), positively
influence the course of the patient's illness (Corrigan, et al., 1990), and help
the families and patients to better cope with the mental illness (Jungbauer et
al., 2002; Sherman et d~., 2003; Addington 2003; Nasser et al., 2005).
Psychoeducation
However, it is understood that there exists a gap between clinical realities
and scientific understandings of any disorder (McFarlane et al, 2003; MurraySwank et al, 2004; Pitschel-Walz et al, 2001; McFarlane et al, 1995; Hogarty
et al, 1991). Families frequently find it difficult to implement the scientific
understanding in their daily practice of managing these patients. This
emphasises the need for structured information programmes tailormade for
particular sets of individuals with specific backgrounds.
A number of different reasons might contribute to the current lack of family
psychoeducation; for example, the timing at which it is being carried out for
a group should be convenient to the participants, that is, it may be beneficial
to carry out family groups in the evenings to allow working family members
t6 participate. On the other hand, some family members are reluctant to take
advantage of such offers (Montero, 1999; Pitschel-Walz, 2003; Angermeyer,
2005) not being sure of how these would benefit them.
In such cases, therapists have to motivate and invite all family members
consistently to attend psychoeducational groups. The therapist should take
into consideration that many family members hesitate to come in contact
with psychiatric institutions. But integrating family members of patients with
schizophrenia or other disorders into psychoeducational groups or family
interventions reduces re-hospitalisation rL~' facilitates support with coping
strategies, and thus, empowers for competent decision making concerning
relapse prevention with antipsychotic medication and thus, significant costs
to the health system and substantial suffering of people with mental illness
and their families could thereby be avoided.
Considering this possible reduction of costs and human suffering, it is important
also that those conducting psychoeducation need to be adequately paid for.
Health insurance companies and hospitals need to find ways for coverage of
the costs of these interventions.
17.7 HOW CAN ONE REACH MORE
PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION?
As explained in Section 17.4 one way to reach more clients is to employ as
many more trained personnel in the process of psychoeducation. Another
way of reaching more patients with psychoeducation might be an adjustment
of the frequency of the sessions. Most institutions offer one psychoeducational
session per week for patients, but because the time that patients with
schizophrenia spend in the hospital is constantly decreasing, conducting 2
sessions per week might allow more patients to participate and also limit the
number of dropouts due to discharge.
Further, it is important that the trained professionals individual in psychoeducation are paid adequately so that they remain motivated to reach out to
more and more people.

2. In what ways can one cater to a larger segment of people using
psychoeducation?
17~8 CARRYING OUT PSYCHOEDUCATION IN
SCHIZOPHRENIA
Schizophrenia is a disruptive, distressing and burdensome illness, for the
people affected and their family members. A number of people" with
schizophrenia, worldwide, live with their families, and they often depend on
a family member's assistance and involvement in providing care at home.
However, these family members are often inadequately prepared to be the
main caregiver for the ill relative. Studies have indicated-that there is a severe
burden imposed upon the whole family when caring for a member with
schizophrenia, because of unpredictable and bizarre behaviour, external
stressors of stigma and isolation, family conflict, emotional frustration and
burnout.
Family intervention, using a diverse ~ange of modalities and a group format,
could satisfy the informational needs of families, and develop a variety of
coping strategies ensuring effective care is provided for a relative with
schizophrenia.
In any psychoeducational programme, the primary caregiver of the patient is
generally recruited as the study participant and is suggested to attend all the
sessions and complete the relevant questionnaires that help assess current
problems faced as well as level of understanding of the subject over time;
other family members and patients mayor may not be invited to attend only
parts of the programme.
Each session begins with a didactic presentation using a PowerPoint
presentation or slides, followed by a group discussion that emphasises the
significance and relevance of information obtained for their family lives.
Caregiving situations and incidents are presented by the caregivers and
alternative ways' of-coping arid resolving their difficulties of care provision
are discussed among the caregivers.

A trained psychiatrist or psychologist then summarises the major findings of
their group discussion and provides recommendations on techniques for patient
management. Other mental health professionals such as social workers may
be invited to be guest lecturers or speakers.
Psychoeducation
Also addressed are the high social stigma associated with mental illness and
seeking mental health services, hierarchical but interdependent family structure,
preference for indirect communication, difficulties in disclosure of feelings to
strangers (at the first few sessions), and high tendency to expect immediate
and practical help.
To work effectively for mutual support in the later sessions, the group
instructor must continuously reinforce the principles of strengthening social
support among the participants, including sharing personal data (ensuring
confidentiality and disclosing information with trust), dialectical process (let
members think about ideas and alternatives to solve problems), discussion of
a taboo area (sharing of secret and internal psychological conflicts),
commonality or a situation of 'all-in-the-same boat' (feeling in similar situation
and working against a common plight), mutual help (reciprocal giving and
receiving help and support among members), and individual problem solving
(helping individual members to address unique troubles).
In-meeting and post-meeting rehearsals and practices in caring for their relative
with mental illness at home are emphasised and evaluated.in each of the later
sessions. Supervision and progress monitoring of the psychoeducation group
is important, and may comprise consistent reviews of the audiotape or minutes
of each session by the trained personnel and regular clarification of problems
and issues arising from each group session.
17.8.1 Benefits of Psychoeducation in Schizophrenia
Psychoeducational interventions belong to a standard therapy programme in
acute and postacute phases of patients with schizophrenia. Modem treatment
guidelines recommend education about schizophrenia as part of the treatment
(APA, 2004). Psychoeducation for patients with schizophrenia improves the
understanding of mental illness, increases the quality of life, and can reduce
relapse rates (Sibitz et aI., 2006; Kilian et aI., 2001; Pitschel- Walz et aI.,
2006). In addition, such interventions are accompanied by a higher level of
compliance, lower rate of relapse, and improved psychopathological status.

Psychoeducation in' schizophrenia, as in any other disorder, begins with the -
formulation cf a functional concept of illness and the construction of a
positive therapeutic alliance, The careful introduction of the diagnosis
"schizophrenia" and ti.c -rnnathic processing of accompanying feelings of
offense and insecurity can initially only take place in the cautious yet
understanding context.
In the case of schizophrenic disorders, a number of generalisable facts that
are commonly applicable to the majority of patients are conveniently passed
on as quickly as possible within groups, This initiates the group solidarity and
a shared fate, which cannot be achieved within the framework of one-to-one
contacts, For this reason, psychoeducation is conceived as a tool for an
optimal combination of the self-help potential of the afflicted and their relatives
on the one hand and instances of professional help on the other hand. Thus,
psychoeducation in schizophrenia serves to work on three different phases:
1. building relationship for therapeutic interaction,
2. understanding the "why" part of the illness (causes),and
3. building effective coping acumen.
The first phase helps in developing rapport and trust in the therapist and the
therapeutic process which is essential for the proces.. to go on smoothly.
Here, the effective ingredient comprises a successful "pn --:essof interaction"
between the therapist and patient; group interactions in the sense of a "shared
fate" also constitute a component of this process. During the" .ond phase,
fundamental background information surrounding the disorder as well as its
.impact on the patient's behaviour must be successfully conveyed. Concerning
building of effective coping acumen, the third phase, the acquisition of
treatment knowledge and practical ~owledge are of foremost importance.

These three fundamental phases of psychotherapeutic work represent the
basis of psychoeducation. The quality of patient-therapist relationship when
interacting with acute and postacute schizophrenic individuals is seen to be
of primary importance. It is only when a bridge can be built to reach these
patients, for the most part characterized through their illness by extreme
mistrust and an attitude of skepticism in view ·of interpersonal relationships
that the other variables - understanding causation and enhancement of coping
competence - can come to bear.
Psychoeducation
First episodes of schizophrenic disorders, however,
"
represent a fully new and
incomprehensible experience. The emerging symptoms, including hearing
voices, tactile hallucinations, delusional perception, thought insertion,
disorganised thinking, etc., are all completely unfamiliar. Accordingly, most
patients and relatives react with helplessness and in an uncoordinated manner.
The symptoms which are specific to a schizophrenic disorder are generally
so strange and so obscure to the normal citizen that even the individual who
has previously proved successful and thrived in life inevitably develops the
feeling that they just cannot believe what is happening.
In order that patients and their relatives are empowered from an early stage
onwards in assuming' the most constructive .role possible in managing the
illness, a "basic competency" with regards to comprehension and handling of
schizophrenia is indispensable. To this end, psychoeducation entails teaching
those affected the "ABC" of schizophrenic disorders and their treatment.
17.8.3 Indications for Participating in a Psychoeducational
Programme
Indications for participating in such a psychoeducational group are wide
ranging. There are only few mandatory contraindications, including massive
formal thought disorders, manic elevated mood, hearing imperative voices,
or acute suicidality with generally reduced stress resilience. Patients can be
integrated within the treatment as soon as they are capable of taking part in
a group for a period of 60 minutes. Ideally only patients suffering from
schizophrenic psychoses should participate in the group, in order not to
evoke unnecessary confusion in other patients through the schizophreniaspecific informational content. '
17.8.4 Structure of Sessions
Group sittings last approximately one hour, take place once to twice a week,
and consist of between 4 and 16 sessions. Group leaders are in most cases
doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists; eo-leaders can be recruited from all
relevant and complementary groups.
17.8.5 The Goal
The superordinate goal can be seen in patients and their relatives acquiring
basic competency in order that they may reach well-informed and selfcompetent decisions as to which of the modern therapeutic options such as,
medical, psychotherapeutic, and,psychosocial, are recommendable and suitable
in their own case.
83

The formulation of an efficient crisis management plan directed at suicide
prevention is of particular importance when dealing with schizophrenia.
Depressive thoughts of resignation or giving up culminating in suicidal
consideration are to be explained as a sign of post-psychotic depression and
on no account made taboo. Additional administration of mood stabilizers,
antidepressants, and tranquilizers together with the parallel involvement of
the social environment are displayed as being normal. Patients are instructed
regularly to take preprescribed emergency medication in the case of early
warning signs and are equipped with crisis telephone numbers for dealing
with emergencies.
There are certain non specific and specific factors involved in psychoeducation
in schiz?phrenia. Let us now consider these.
17.8.6 Non-specific Effective Factors of Psychoeducation
Some of the non-specific effective factors of psychoeducation are given below:
• Development of a good therapeutic relationship,
• Unconditional appreciation,
• Empathic response to participants,
• Respectful attention to su~j~ctively deviant opinions,
• Need and resource-orientated procedures,
• Stimulation of hope and reassurance,
• Encouragement of personal exchange of experiences, and
• Facilitation of "shared fate".
Only when a certain level of trust is established, are patients with schizophrenia
prepared to be integrated into a group aiming to form a functional concept
of the illness. After all, psychoeducation is of course a voluntary act requiring
patients to partake of their own free will. Nevertheless, the commitment and
expertise of professionals are crucial in motivating patients and their relatives
to voluntarily cooperate.
17.8.7 Specific Effective Factors of Psychoeducation: Key
Information and Emotional Topics
Key Information Relating to the Illness and Treatment Measures:
Information with respect to the following needs to be elaborated upon:
• Term "schizophrenia"
• Symptoms (positive and negative symptoms)
• Origin of symptoms: dopamine excess with disturbance in information
processmg
• Vulnerability-stress-coping model
• Medication and side effects
• Psychotherapeutic interventions and suicide prevention

• Psychosocial measures
• Early warning signs, crisis plan, and relapse prevention
In addition to these specific factors, emotional, illness-related topics are
deliberately discussed. In addition to emotions with a positive overtone, such
as pride in one's own role, as an expert or the feeling of being particularly
individual and original, more negatively emotional topics, such as being out
of one's depth or struggling with one's fate, are also addressed.
Topics with positive and those with negative overtone are discussed. These
may include:
Topics with a Positive Overtone
• Feeling of being ingenious and special,
• Sensitivity as a sign of particular individuality,
• Pride in own role as an "expert" of psychosis,
• Expansion of' coping competency through psychoeducation,
• Psychosis as an object of fascination,
• Acceptance of "being as lam",
• Looking for meaning by coping with illness,
• Solidarity of group with "shared fate", and
• Support from social network.
Topics with a Negative Overtone
• Insecurity,
• Being out of one's depth,
• Alleged rareness and singleness of own fate,
• Anger and grief,
• Resignation,
• Struggling with own fate, and
• Isolation.
Thus, the take-home-message of psychoeducational programmes for
schizophrenia must be as follows: schizophrenic psychoses are induced by
biological factors in combination with psychosocial stress; therefore, they
must be treated with both medication and psychotherapeutic interventions.
Empowerment of patients can only be successfully developed on the basis of
sufficient medication and long-term elements of psychosocial treatment.

17.8.8 Psychotherapeutic Techniques within
Psychoeducation
The primary goal of psychoeducational interventions consists in finding a
common thread between the objective, textbook medical knowledge with
regards to background information of the disorder and treatment measures,
and the subjective viewpoint of the afflicted individual. Carrying out this
procedure is often not so simple. Important psychotherapeutic elements, as

17.9 LET US SUM UP
In this Unit, we have learnt that a number of key points must be kept in mind
while doing psychoeducation. Psychoeducation has to be a highly structured
curriculum-based module. It -should contain informational contents that are
interactively compiled: It must help patients to gain access to information'
concerning appropriate mental health behaviour. Any psychoeducational
programme must begin with the individualised experienced-based knowledge
of the participants, which" when combined with a basic medical textbook
knowledge of schizophrenic disorders helps the therapist develop appropriate
treatment strategies. While individual opinions are appreciated and respected,
great value is placed on clearly and comprehensibly presenting current
scientifically founded expert knowledge in the form of-direct information and
advice giving.
It is important to construct a comprehensible concept of the illness and its
treatment (causal and control attribution); for example, enabling lay persons
to more fully understand why mental problems can be successfully treated by
"chemical" interventions, is of great significance for increasing functionality.
In this capacity, psychoeducation can he seen to serve an "interpreter" function,
pursuing the aim of translating complicated "technical jargon" into common
and everyday language.which can be understood by patients and their relatives
and .helps them to become -experts of the illness., .
Psychoeducation

In effect psychoeducation should aim at helping the participant's progress to
a higher stage with treatment of each informational unit and further leave
each session feeling encouraged and full of hope.
Psychoeducation is primarily a form of therapy conveying reassurance and
hope, with the aim of optimally integrating empowerment of those affected
with professional therapeutic techniques in a working and therapeutic alliance.
The formulation of realistic and coherent therapeutic goals is of particular
importance for all involved; patients, relatives, and professional auxiliaries.
Goals which are too high and indeed unattainable must be deleted at the
outset.
The very strength of psychoeducation lies in the deliberate focus upon patients
and their relatives attaining basic competence in the area of schizophrenic
psychosis. In light of the feelings of helplessness and overload with which
many patients and their families are confronted, especially at the onset of the
illness, this particular element is in no way of secondary importance. On the
contrary, it is only when a basic understanding of the illness and its requisite
therapeutic measures have been established that more continual and specific
therapeutic elements can be employed. Too many elements of communication
training, problem solving, training of social competence, etc, should not be
integrated into short-term psychoeducational programmes.
Similarly, not all types of patients and relatives can be helped with
psychoeducation. One may have to exclude those patients who are particularly
severely ill. For patients suffering from a less severe schizophrenic clinical
course, these basic orientation sessions may, together with information about
relapse prevention, be adequate in providing stability. In the case of more
seriously impaired patients, these groups can be successful in motivating and
convincing individuals to opt for involvement in long term and more differential
therapy. Chronic patients can, through .recurrent integration in this group
concept, be sent a sign of hope insofar as they have not been abandoned to
their fate despite multiple relapses. Patients thus sense that others believe
that they are able to recover in the face of repeated relapses.
Psychoeducation when combined with sustained medical intervention and
long term psychosocial management proves to be more effective.

18.1 INTRODUCTION
According to the Oxford dictionary, skills are, "the abilities to do something
well". We require skills in performing everyday tasks. Some of these tasks
are common to most of us, such as, getting up in the morning, eating food,
drinking water and so forth. To do these tasks we require skills. Some of the
skills which are required include,
• Fine and gross motor skills for movement,
• Time management skills to initiate and finish the activity in particular amount
~~ 1• Thinking skills and so forth.
However-we also perform certain tasks which maybe unique to us, forinstance,
not everyone amongst us will know how to drive a car. In fact, reading this
text also requires certain skills. Some of these skills include:
• Visual skills to see the text,
• Skills to read spellings, and
• Skills to understand the meanings of the words in English language, and
so on,
92 Even when we say that we know how to do a certain task, there are various
"-'~~ J
I
skill levels at which we are able to accomplish the task. For instance, in a
group of cricketers, all of them know the rules of the game and play cricket,
we still judge them on their expertise and thus, comment on who is more
skilful on certain parameters as compared to another. Thus, there are various
levels of skills acquisition as well.
There is no one fixed way in which skills can be classified. However some
of the clusters of skills include, life skills, social skills, and vocational skills. It
may be noted that this is not a rigid classification of skills. Skills that are part
of one cluster may be a part of another cluster also.
An important aspect about skills is that they -can be learned. However, the
expertise of the skill which can be acquired depends on a combination of many
factors which include:
Social Skills Therapy
• Physical factors such as a blind person will not be able to drive a car
since there is no vision. Thus, for certain skills to be acquired there are
certain physical pre-requisites;
• Motivation of an individual to acquire a skill;
• Abilities of an individual; and
• Skill level of the model or the trainer from whom the individual is learning
. the skill.
_ In this Unit, we will be focus sing on social skills therapy. Social skills are a
set of skills through which we interact, relate and communicate with others.
We will focus on various techniques through which social skills can be acquired.

to individuals with ADHD, autism and schizophrenia.
18.2 SOCIAL SIQLLS THERAPY:
INTRqnucTloN AND TECHINQUES
Social skills therapy includes a set of standard behavioural techniques or learning
activities that enable children, adolescents and adults to establish or restore
practical skills in domains required to meet the interpersonal, self-care and coping
demands of community living. In order to understand the techniques of imparting
'. social skills therapy, it is' very important to understand the concept of social
skills and how they are acquired; and the need for social skills therapy. The
following sub-sections focus on the acquisition and the relevance, of social skills
and types of social skills and thereafter, the focus will be on basic techniques
of social skins therapy.

18.2.1 Relevance of Social Skills
Social skills are interpersonal behaviours which are learned or acquired by
individuals and are important for establishing and maintaining socially rewarding
relationships. We can say that an individual is socially competent when she or
he is able to engage in socially appropriate behaviour with others and is aware
of her or his actions in relation to self as well as others. However, the social
norms for appropriate behaviour are determined by cultural and situational
factors. For instance, in Japanese culture when people meet each other they
greet them by bowing as compared to shaking hands for greeting which is
followed in many other cultures. Nonetheless, social skills are an important
aspect of interacting with others in every culture.
The foundation for learning social skills is laid during childhood, wherein the
child starts learning them through the process of socialisation, observing others,
getting feedback on his or her actions. However, it is difficult for certain
individuals to acquire or maintain cert~n aspects of social skills. Some of these
conditions in which social skills acquisition can be deficit include the following:
• Disorders such as ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, mental retardation;
r
• Child sexual abuse: A child who has grown up with physical or sexual
abuse is prone to develop feelings of shame, guilt and may become isolated
from others, unable to trust others and may find it difficult to establish social
relationships with others; and
• Individuals with personality traits of shyness and introversion often find it
difficult to initiate conversations with others in public situations and express
themselves.
It is important to note that social skill deficit is not necessarily found in children
or adults with disorders but it can be present in any individual on any particular
aspect of social,skills. Moreover; factors like motivation and lack of reinforcement
also influence the individual for demonstrating social skills. Social skills are
necessary since, individuals who lack certain social skills find it difficult to interact
positively with others and thus, there are chances that their self-esteem may
become low. Let's now look at a few domains of social skills.
18.2.2 Types of Social Skills
A very important component of social skills is interpersonal relationship skill.
Therefore, communication is an important component of socialskill.Communication
includes both expressive and receptive domains. Some of the components/of ' .-
expressive communication include the speech content, pitch of voice, and rate
of speaking. While expressing it is also important to percei ve situations in which
one is required to speak and in which one is not required to speak. For example,
we all know that while writing an exam in the examination hall, we are not
supposed to engage in conversation with our friend about a movie which we
watched the other day. However, a child with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), because of her or his impulsivity, may blurt out things when
not even asked or in situations where silence is expected. Additionally, nonverbal components of communication are very crucial while we are expressing
ourselves which includes, looking in the eye of the other person, our body posture
and so forth. Children with disorders such as autism, ADHD find it difficult
to understand non-verbal aspects of communication.

Receptive aspect of communication is the ability to understand-what the other
person is communicating and to structure our responses in a relevant manner.
, A significant component of receptive communication is to understand the subtle
cues in the conversation which include, to gauge when someone wants to change
the topic of conversation etc. Some people with or without emotional disorders
don't have adequately ti~vc,!vped ability to read the subtle cues transacted in
social interactions. These cues include both verbal and non-verbal cues. For
example, a person with developed social skills is able to interpret in conversation
when the other person is saying a joke or giving a sarcastic comment. However,
for some children with learning disability, it is difficult to understand the jokes
or sarcasm in conversation. Similarly, there are many other aspects of emotions
which are reflected verbally and non-verbally in social interactions. It is to be
noted that individuals with certain disorders have poor ability to recognise social
and affective cues such as individuals with ADHD, schizophrenia and mental
retardation. Therefore, in many instances their communication is,impaired. Ability
to understand social and affective cues and to communicate play an important
role in establishing and maintaining social relationships such as friendships,
marriages etc. Thus, individuals with social skills deficit in these areas have
difficulty in establishing and maintaining these relationships. Some important social
skills which help in developing and maintaining socially rewarding relationships
-include the following:
• Sharing and cooperating with others,
• Listening to others,
• Displaying respect to others,
Social Skills Therapy
,
• Being empathetic,
• Taking turns,
• Participating in activities,
• .Communicating politely with others, and ~
• Being assertive.
Remember that skills such as ability to take care of one-self, performing the
activities of daily living independently in accordance with the age have an impact
on the social skills. '
Social skills therapy aims at helping the individuals overcome their social skills
deficit by using certain behavioural principles and strategies. The impact of social
skills therapy is however, dependent on the severity of the disorder. For instance,
a child with mild mental retardation can learn money transaction if taught using
modelling or role-play. However, even if we use these methods with a child
with severe mental retardation, she or he will not be able to learn money
transaction.
. Social skills therapy not"only focuses on overcoming social skills deficit such
as improving eye-contact and listening skills but also enables individuals with
or without emotional disorders to learn how to deal in specific situations. Some'
of these situations in which social skills therapy is imparted include, conversation
skills in specific situations, telephone conversation manners, interacting in job
situations, doing shopping and so forth.
95

desired behaviour and undesired behaviours are demonstrated such that
it is clear to the client that which behaviour gets rewarded and which does
not. For learning to take place, the behaviour is presented many times and
by several models.
Thus, modelling can be used effectively for learning behaviours such as listening
to others, being empathetic, assertion skills and many more interpersonal skills.
2. Role-playing: Once effective modelling has taken place, it is recommended
that role-play of the desired behaviour is done. Role-play is a simulated situation
Which demonstrates the social skill to be enhanced. Through role-play the client
gets the opportunity to practise the modelled behaviour which contributes to
effective learning. Role-play is also an effective tool for acquiring new desirable
responses and unlearning the previous (undesirable) ones. Through role-play,
the therapist is able to assess the ability of an individual before the therapy
and train the individual in acquiring desired response. Then, the individual is
made to rehearse the skills which are developed through subsequent role-plays.
Role-plays can be conductedin group as well as in one-to-one situation.
Feedback given after the role-play has an important role in maintaining the new
behaviour. For example, for developing conversation skills, a role-play situation
can be created to practise conversation skills in various situations. It is only
through practise in many sessions that the skills get developed. Also, each skill
has many components; therefore, for enhancing every component different roleplays are to be conducted. For children with ADHD, socially anxious children,
autism, role-play method is an effective technique to develop desired social
behaviour. Children with ADHD fmd it difficult to behave appropriately in social
situations. Similarly children with autism, and asperger syndrome fmd it difficult
to initiate conversation, and see others' view points. These can be developed
through role-plays. Through role-play they can be taught desirable responses.
However, one should remember that there will be a ceiling limit on the,level
of skills which can be acquired by child or adult with emotional difficulty because
of the limitations imposed by the condition of the disorder. Other skills which
can be developed through role-plays include, showing empathy, introducing one's
self to others, being a good listener, money transaction etc. Role-play is an
effective medium for transferring the learning from the clinic situation to the reallife situation. To ensure transfer of learning to real-life situation practice is.a

Social Skills Therapy
As already mentioned giving feedback and reinforcement is essential for bringing,
a long-lasting change in behaviour, and therefore, the demonstration of desirable
behaviour during a role-play should be given feedback and reinforcement.
Through feedback, suggestions on improving the behaviour on certain aspects
need to be given. We will now look at reinforcements which have an important
role to ensure that the behaviour learnt is maintained. We will also discuss a
method of giving reinforcements which is 'contingency management'.
3. Reinforcement: Reinforcement is defined as a consequence which follows
the display of behaviour and thereby attempts to increase the frequency of the
occurrence of the behaviour. Reinforcement is provided through reinforcers.
Reinforcers are stimuli which when given after the occurrence of behaviour
increases the probability of the occurrence of that behaviour. Some examples
of reinforcers include: food items, toy materials, praise and so forth.
Reinforcers can be positive or negative. Positive reinforcer is a stimulus/
consequence which when given after a behaviour increases the probability that 97

Modalities of Counselling and
Family Therapy
98
the behaviour will occur again. For example, if a child greets guests and the
parents praises the child for the behaviour, the child is likely to repeat the
behaviour of greeting guests in other situations as well, since the child received
a positive response. However, negative reinforcer is a 'stimulus' whose
termination is dependent on a behaviour, which increases the probability that
the behaviour will occur again. It is important to note that negative implies that
behaviour will Cause the termination of an event or stimulus. For example, by
completing school work (behaviour), the child wards off teachers' scolding
(event), therefore, since completion of school work led to avoidance of teachers'
scolding, the child will repeat the behaviour of completing the school work.
A very important point to be noted here is that for each child the value of
reinforcer will differ.Thus, the reinfocers are selected according to what motivates
a particular child.
During the social skills therapy coaching sessions, the individual is given
reinforcers on the display of desirable behaviour. Reinforcers help in the
acquisition of behaviour and in the maintenance of the behaviour. Here, we are
giving an example of using reinforcers in a systematic and consistent manner.
Contingency management is a method which involves contingent presentation
and withdrawal of rewards and punishments. Here the therapist also trains others
such as parents and teachers to function as contingency managers. Lets'
understand the method. First, a baseline assessment is done to establish the
relative frequency or infrequency of the behaviour which has been identified to
be changed. Thereafter, reinforcers are selected. Reinforcers could be primary,
that is, tangible products such as favourite food, toy etc., or secondary that
is, praise, tokens etc. Things or responses that act as reinforcers for one child
may not do so for others. Reinforcers should be specified prior to actual initiation
of treatment. A contingency plan is spelled out clearly in advance, for example
the child is told that every time the child will greet guests when they come
to her or his house, she or he will get the decided number of tokens. A personal
token system is worked out, points are assigned to various activities, for instance,
taking forward the example of greeting guests; every time the child greets guests,
she or he gets 4 tokens. A reward, that is the reinforcement is decided for
say 20 tokens. Remember, contingencies are clearly spelled out in advance,
child and contingency manager make formal agreements about elements to be
in effect. There is a clear specification-of target behaviours and reinforcers that
will be made contingent upon them. In case of behaviours not being demonstrated,
withdrawal of reinforcer is usually planned in the contingency plan. Given below
is an illustration of a star/token chart.

To get the child used to the star chart system you may give rewards for lower
number of stars in the initial stages as well. The value of the reward may
I
correspond with the number of stars. This type of a record can help a child
or adult see 'the number of tokens earned and thus how many tokens they need
more to get the reward.'
Here, another component of reinforcement which is self-reinforcement is
important for the client to learn. Initially, external reinforcement is important to
ensure that the behaviour is learnt by the client. At the same time, while the
client is being given external reinforcement, the therapist makes aware the client
of the self-reinforcement aspect as well. The client is taught to do self-praise
after the desired behaviour is performed. The goal of reinforcement is to shift
gradually from external reinforcement to internal reinforcement, since that ensures
that the behaviour will be maintained for a longer period of time.
Social Skins Therapy
18.2.4 Generalisation of Social Skills
Therefore, using the above mentioned techniques•.different aspects of social skills
therapy can be taught. A very important component of social skills therapy is
ensuring that behaviour learnt in the clinic setting is transferred or generalized
to other settings in the real world. Following are a guidelines which help to
ensure that transfer of skills will take place:
1. The client should be explained the rationale, rules and strategies for using
the skills.
2. Enough amount of time should be given for practice of new skills in correct
manner.
3. While the client is under-going social skills therapy, the client should be
given opportunities to practice new skills in varied interpersonal settings.
4. ' Reinforcements should be given to the client on practising appropriate
behaviour.
5. Focus on developing internal reinforcement of the client, and
6. Give frequent home-works to the client which focus on practising the desired
behaviour. The family members of the client can be involved for ensuring
that certain situations are simulated at home for the desired behaviour to
be practised. The client's progress report is maintained either by the client
or by the adult in case the client is a child. . '

18.3 SOCIAL SKILLS THERAPY IN
DIFFERENT DISORDERS
Let's now look at social skills therapy for different disorders:
18.3.1 Social Skills Therapy for Individuals with ADHD
As you all know individuals with ADHD exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity,
impulsivity and inattention. Because of these symptoms, they experience various
difficulties- social difficulties;difficultiesin establishing interpersonal relationships
and so on. Through social skills therapy, the child or -adult with ADHD, can
be trained to become less aggressive, become more attentive of her or his actions
and others' expectations and overallbehave in a more socially responsive way.
Before exploring some of the social skills therapy techniques for people with
ADHD, let's briefly look at how people with ADHD miss out OH ,1,veloping
social skills. We have already discussed that the foundation for social skills is
laid during childhood, wi~ most of the acquisition taking place from observing
behaviours of others, practising the behaviour and getting feedback. Along with
observation, children pick up social skills through indulging in various play
/
/I
activities such as make-believe play, collaborative learning and engaging in other
interactive activities during childhood. Thus, observation and feedback from
others especially peers play an important role towards developing social skills.
However children with ADHD, find it difficult to observe others in a systematic
manner (due to inattention, hyperactivity or impulsivity) and thus, they miss out
on details of social interaction. This is not to indicate that they don't pick up
any social skills on their own. They may pick up some aspects of appropriate
behaviour, but they don't have the understanding of social expectations in totality.
Social Skills Therapy
Another factor which has an impact on their acquisition of social skills derives
.from the fact that their inability to understand social skills leads to negative
responses from others. These negative responses from others may be in the
form of peer rejection which reduces the opportunities to learn social skills.
Thus, they are caught in a vicious cycle. Some of the social difficulties which
are faced by children or adults with ADHD include the following:
• Difficulty in establishing and maintaining friendships;
• Disturbances in peer relationships;
.• Inadequate social behaviours (such as not knowing how to stand in a queue;
sharing toys; asking for-help and so forth);
• Difficulty in reading the emotional cues in conversations like difficulty in
reading facial expressions, and tone of voice of others;
• Interrupting conversations to put forth their point; difficulty in responding
to others; and
•. Blurting out answer in the class without seeking permission.
Thus, social skills therapy for children with ADHD focuses on:
• Helping children acquire appropriate social skills;
• Make them aware of their behaviours, strengths and limitations;
• Enabling children to efficiently use the social skills in different settings .
•
To help the children acquiii!appropriate social skills, quite a few of the times,
these skills are taught to the children in a group setting. A brief overview of
the process which isusually followed to impart social skills to the children with
ADHD is given below:
*
The first step before imparting social skills is to do an assessment of the
current level of social skills which are present and the gaps in the skills.
Then, identify one behaviour or skill to be enhanced at a time;
*
The selected behaviour is broken into smaller portions;
*
Various techniques are used to demonstrate the targeted behaviour. Some
of these techniques include giving verbal instructions, modelling the targeted
behaviour (demonstrations by the therapist), showing video. of the targeted
behaviour, coaching children to role-play the targeted behaviour. Positive .
feedback and reinforcement is given by the therapist for demonstrating
appropriate behaviour; and
101
I
Modalities of Counselling and
Family Therapy
102
*
Once the social skills are acquired, the next step is to enable the child
with ADHD to apply the acquired social behaviour appropriately in \ arious
social settings. For this, parents and teachers are coached to create positive
and responsive environment at home and school. Through the parent or
teacher therapy, adults learn to prompt and reinforce the child to use the
newly acquired behaviour in appropriate situations. Moreover, they are also·
trained in several behavioural strategies which can be used with the child
at home, and when the child is interacting with other family members. Parents
or teachers are also taught through role-plays the behaviours which they
need to demonstrate while dealing with the child in various situations. In
an attempt to ensure that the skills have been acquired by parents or
. teachers they are also given home-works to monitor child's progress by
undertaking certain defined activities with the child for a period of time.
Another aspect which is a focus of many social skills therapy programmes
for parents/teachers is the technique of giving commands to children with
ADHD, and developing contingency management schedules for reinforcing
positive behaviour.
It can be concluded that though children with ADHD have problems in developing
and maintaining relationships with others which has an impact on their overall
life, however, with socials skills therapy and a responsive environment at school,
home etc, their skills can be improved. The impact will be higher when the
social skills are taught to the child from a younger age. It is best when the
child is trained in social skills through a professional along with the coaching
of the parents. The therapy is most effective when there is enough practice
and reinforcement at home and school. Remember, that as the child starts seeing
the positive .results of her or his appropriate behaviour, she or he gets reinforced
to demonstrate those behaviours more often and thus this way the child is able
to acquire the social skills. To emphasise again, the skills will only be learnt
if they are practised sufficiently in different settings through the involvement of
..•
parents, teachers or counsellors.
18.3.2 Social Skills Therapy for Individuals with
Schizophrenia .;,..
Social skills therapy for individuals with schizophrenia is useful along with
pharmacological therapy. Some of the social skills deficit which individuals
with schizophrenia demonstrate are listed below:
• Poor eye contact and odd facial expressions,
• Unrelated responses in the conversation, and
• Lack of perception of emotions in other people.
Social skills therapy is helpful for managing these social skills deficits. Social
skillstherapy programmes for schizophrenics aim at improving conversation skills,
conflict management skills, assertivenessskills, performing activities of daily living,
work and vocational skills. The social skills therapy has been shown to help
the patients adjust better in the society after their treatment. Usually, when the
patient is in the day-care centre, social skills therapy is imparted.
. .r
Thetherapy is impartedusing similar principles as have mentioned for ADHD.
Thus, a typical-session may focus on one aspect of social interaction, which
can be taught using several techniques including role-play, demonstrations and

,
"
feedback from the therapist. The important aspect of generalising the skill learnt
to the real-world setting is also taken under consideration. In order to promote
generalizations of the skills in real-world settings, the patients are trained in daycare centres; therapeutic communities; short-stay at the psychiatric ward and
so forth. During the course of stay, activities for enhancing skills in various social
domains are planned. And since the setting is a community based setting,
opportunities for rehearing and generalizing the skills in the real world setting
are many. Moreover, there is a scope for receiving feedback from the other
patients as well. This acts as a reinforcement.
Social Skills Therapy
Some of the methods which are employed include role-playing, token economy/
contingency management. As we have already been discussing, each social skill
has several components. Therefore, the individual components are taught one
by' one, using role-play, modelling etc. as procedures. Therapy is also provided
in developing social perception skills which is the ability to interpret social and
affective cues in conversation. There is a strong evidence to suggest that social
skills therapy, when carefully designed and delivered, can increase patients'
knowledge and skill levels, make them better adjusted members in the community
and goes a long way in preventing relapses. However, for the results to be
achieved and maintained the programme needs to be simple and yet at the same
time specific enough to do justice to the individual case.
Let's look in detail at one of the set-ups in which social skills therapy is provided
to people with schizophrenia. This set-up is called Therapeutic Community
(TC). Therapeutic community is a set-up (mostly residential) which along with
treating individuals with chronic disorders such as schizophrenia, or bipolar
affective disorders, also promotes their rehabilitation through enhancing their
social and vocational skills. It is a tertiary care set-up. Either TC has only one
kind of patients or patients with schizophrenia, and bipolar affective disorders
together. Patients, who are responding positively to the medicines and are
recovering, can be referred to therapeutic communities, Through therapeutic
community they are able to develop their selves, social and vocational skills.
This set-up can be located in the hospital extension or exist independently.
A safe community environment is created, in which the patients are often called
residents of community. The hierarchy with the doctors or nurses is relaxed
•
here. However, there are clear rules and expectations which are set by the
. )
significant involvement of residents. Here, the doctors' role becomes more of
a facilitator who acts as moderator when required. All these processes are
facilitated by the doctors. The members contribute in running of the unit. The
main aim of the unit is to help the patients become independent, responsible
and empowered to enable their integration in the society. Therefore, TC is
structured in a way which provides them with opportunities to take up
responsibilities, share and care for each other. Moreover, it also helps towards
reducing the dependency on the professionals.
The basic premise is that an individual is assisted to accept her or his past
enactrnents. Along with this, the individual is also helped to learn social, creative
and vocational skills. After a detailed psychological assessment of every
individual, an individual plan is developed, which includes attending one to one
therapy sessions, medication to be followed, skill therapy. In addition to the
individual sessions, group sessions are also undertaken. Since it is based on
the community model, there is an increased emphasis on group activities. Thus,
group psvchotherapy sessions, peer groups, communirv meetings, and group103

Modalities of Counselling and
Family Therapy
104
based social skills therapy are undertaken. Activities such as yoga, therapy, and
teaching of various vocational skills etc. are also undertaken.
A typical day in a TC begins with a community meeting which is chaired usually
by a resident. It is to be noted that the members of the TC undertake a contract
with the community (once they are comfortable in the TC after their admission),
that they will follow the rules of the community, us~ the resources effectively
and be involved in helping each other to get well. In the commupity meeting,
difficulties and experiences of the members are shared. It is usually seen in case
of individuals with personality disorder that there are chances of splitting
happening in the community.
(Splitting) This is a phenomenon often seen in patients with personality
disorders: typically, -one staff member is privy to the vulnerable side of
the patient - made to feel special and drawn into a rescuing role - while
the rest of the team feel irritated by the patient's destructive behaviour
and are more in toucb with the manipulative aspect of his or her personality.
These splits often develop in teams, with both sides blaming the other for .1
the patient's worsening state. An understanding that team members are
holding different aspects of the patient's personality can potentially redeem
the situation and inform psychological understanding. Therapeutic
communities are therefore structured to discourage 'secrets' and 'special
relationships' between individuals and subgroups. (Campling, 2001)
Thus, through the community meetings, open discussions are encouraged and
members are given the space to freely express themselves and their feelings.
After the community meetings, individual and group activities are undertaken
in a routine manner. Structures such as mentor group (group formed along
with the staff members with which the residents are comfortable; therefore,
depending on the number of residents, there could be more than one mentor
groups), buddies (forming pairs of members who are comfortable with each
other) etc., are also functional in many therapeutic communities which encourage
members to develop and maintain interpersonal relationships. Periodic review
and evaluation is undertaken of each member's achievement of short-term goals.
They are also assessed on the rating scales for their level of functioning. Based
on the assessment and achievement of their various individual goals (skills they
acquired), they leave the therapeutic community. There is a regular follow-up
of the members even after they have left. Research has indicated that therapeutic
communities are effective in social and vocational rehabilitation of patients with
disorders, back in the society.
18.3.3 Social Skills Therapy' for Children with Autism
You all have studied earlier in other Units that varying levels of difficulty in social
interaction is one of the cardinal features which most children with autism face.
Some of the key aspects of difficulty in social interaction include the followings:
1. Inability to develop eye to eye contact,
2. Failure to develop age appropriate peer relationships, and
3. Lack of social and emotional reciprocity.
Additionally, communication skills of children with autism are also impaired. Some
of these impairments include (a child with autism may display one or more of
the following impairments):

'.
1. Lack of language development or delayed language development;
2. In spite of language development, marked impairment in the ability to
initiate conversation with others; and
Social Skills Therapy
3. Stereotyped use of language.
Another difficulty which most of the children with autism face is the inability
to read subtle cues in the conversation. We have already discussed the role
of subtle cues in conversation at the beginning of this Unit. This difficulty at
times can lead them to a tough situation wherein children with autism can at
times, say inappropriate things, hurt others, also get into a situation where they
are bullied, teased etc.
Social skills therapy focuses on helping children with autism manage these
difficulties. It is important to note that depending on the severity of the impairment,
the intensity of social skills therapy will differ. Also, depending on the child's
impairment on the autism spectrum, there will be a limit to which the child will
be able to acquire the skills.
It is to be noted that social skills therapy for children with autism is a specialised
area and the therapists undergo special therapy to deal with children with autism.
Here, we are giving a brief overview of the social skills therapy for children
with autism. The exact methodology of social skills therapy for children with
autism may undergo a change depending on the school of thought of therapy
followed.
Social skills therapy for children with autism is conducted in both individual and
group settings. For quite a few children with autism, they respond positively
to therapy in one to one setting. Gradually, group activities focus sing on the
specific goals are also conducted with them. Some of the skills which are
focussed are playing, initiating and responding to conversations, and developing
peer relationships. As has been shared earlier, here also, target behaviour is
selected, it is broken in to smaller portions, each portion is taught using various
strategies such as role-plays, and video or live demonstration. Reinforcement
is given for the demonstration of behaviour in the clinic setting. Once the skill
is demonstrated in the clinic setting, then the task of generalising the skill to
•
other settings is undertaken. In order to ensure that the acquired social skill
is generalised to the social setting, the reinforcement for children with autism
should be substantial, that is, when the child displays the acquired skill in the
social setting, she or he should be reinforced substantially. Thereafter, the child
should be reinforced by praise to enable the maintenance of the behaviour in
social settings.
18.4 USE OF SOCIAL SKILLS THERAPY
ALONG WITH OTHER THERAPIES
Social skills therapy is used with other therapies as well. For example, for treating
social phobia, social skills therapy is used along with cognitive restructuring and
coping. skills therapy. For treating schizophrenia, social skills therapy is used
along with pharmacological treatment and family therapy.

Modalities of Counselling and 18.3.5 Precautions While Doing Social Skills Therapy
Family Therapy
Some of important precautions are listed below, which a therapist should keep
in mind while doing social skills therapy:
1. Before planning social skills therapy for any individual, objective assessment
of the patient's actual difficulties while interacting or relating with others
needs to be undertaken. Once an assessment of the difficulties is made,
the severity of the disorder also needs to be assessed. The assessment
of the severity of the disorder enables the therapist to project the individual's
capacity to acquire the skill. This will help in objective goal-setting.
2. While undertaking social skills therapy with clients, the therapist should
move at a pace which does not weigh down the client by focus sing
on changing too many behaviours at one time.
3. Also, while imparting therapy, the therapist should be cautious that '
patients don't feel inadequate for their present level of social skills.
4. The social skills therapy will be complete only when the skill learnt during
the therapy setting is transferred to the real-life situations. This is called
generalization. For generalization to take place, the therapy should have
a clear focus. It is also dependent on the motivation of the client to learn
the skill.

18.4 LET US SUM UP
In this Unit, we learnt about social skills therapy. For understanding social skills
therapy, we first explored the concept of social skills. Social skills are
interpersonal behaviours which are learned or acquired by individuals and are
important for establishing and maintaining socially rewarding relationships.
Interpersonal skills are one of the components of social skills, thus communication
skills form an important part of social skills. Some of the examples of social
skills include cooperating with others, listening to others, displaying empathy and
so forth. The foundation for social skills is laid during childhood. Due to certain
disorders and personality related factors, children or adults can lack social skills.
These social skills can be enhanced through social skills therapy. Next, we
explored social skills therapy. Social skills therapy includes a set of standard
behavioural techniques or learning activities that enable children, adolescents and
adults to establish or restore practical skills in domains required to meet the
interpersonal, self-care and coping demands of community living. Important
aspects before undertaking social skills therapy were also discussed. Some of
these include, undertaking a detailed assessment of the individual's current
functioning in the social domain along with the nature of disorder which the
individual is facing due to which social skills deficit is present. Broadly, some
of the key methods used to impart social skills therapy such as modelling,
reinforcement and role-playing were also discussed. Modelling is observational
learning which is the first step to teach the client social skills. The client observes
the social skill which is demonstrated by a live or a symbolic model. Certain
aspects about selection of a model which need to be kept in mind were also
discussed. The importance of practising the modelled behaviour through roleplaying has been highlighted in the Unit. Role-play is a simulated situation in
which the social skill to be enhanced is practised by the client along with the
therapist or other people. It can be done in individual as well as in group settings.
Other applications of role-play in the context of social skills therapy have also
been discussed in the Unit. Finally, for ensuring that the behaviour is internalised
and learnt, the importance of reinforcement and generalisation of the skills to
real-settings h· ~"Afl highlighted in the Unit. Reinforcement is the consequence
after the demo , i of behaviour. Both positive and negative reinforcement,
as well as contiugen. management have been discussed. Thereafter, since
for different disorders, the nature of social skills deficit differs, very briefly the
nature of social skills deficit in ADHD, schizophrenia and autism were discussed.
Consequently, very briefly a few strategies for social skills therapy for each of
the disorder were also outlined. Some precautions which need to be followed
while imparting social skills therapy, including setting up the expectations
appropriately; and ensuring generalization of the behavi . 16~t .in ,the
therapeutic setting. 107

18.5 GLOSSARY
Contingency:
management
A method which involves contingent presentation and
withdrawal of rewards and punishments.
Modelling, also known as observationalleaming is based
on behavioural principles of learning. Usually, a model
demonstrates a particular behaviour and the individual
who wants to learn particular behaviour observes the
model.
Modelling:
Reinforcement : The consequence which follows on the display of
behaviour and thereby attempts to increase the frequency
of the occurrence of the behaviour.
'.
Reinforcer : Reinforcers are stimuli which when given after the
occurrence of a behaviour increase the probability of
the occurrence of the behaviour.
Role-playing : A method in which simulated situation is created in which
the client is able to practise the social skill to be
enhanced. It is also used for demonstrating the social
skill to be enhanced.
Skills The abilities to do something well. They are required
to perform everyday tasks. Certain skills are innate and
some of them are acquired.
Skills which help in establishing and maintaining
relationships with others. .Most of these skills are
acquired through social interactions, observing others and
getting feedback from others.
Social skills therapy is given to those individuals (adults
or children) who have social skills deficits in certain
domains. Social skills therapy follows behavioural
principles of learning, some of them being modelling,
role-playing and so forth.
A set-up (mostly residential) which along with treating
individuals with chronic disorders such as schizophrenia,
bipolar affective disorders, also promotes their
rehabilitation through enhancing their social, vocational
skills.

1. Skills: Skills are the abilities to do something well. They are required to
perform everyday tasks. Skills can be categorised in several ways, for
example, fine motor and gross motor skills; skills to type and so forth.
Certain skills are innate and some of them are acquired.
2. Social skills : Social skills are a kind of skills which help in establishing
and maintaining relationships with others. We say that an individual is socially
competent when she or he is able to engage in socially appropriate behaviour
with others and is aware of her or his actions in relation to self as well
as others. Certain prerequisite conditions are required for the development
of social skills. Though social skills broadly aim at maintaining and
establishing relationships, some of the behaviours depicting social skills differ
from culture to culture.
Social Skills Therapy
3. Social skillstherapy: Social skillstherapy is given to those individuals (adults
or children) who have social skill deficits in certain domains. The foundation
for learning social skills is laid during childhood, wherein the child starts
learning them through the process of socialization, observing others, getting
feedback on her or his actions: However, it is difficult for certain individuals
to acquire or maintain certain aspects of social skills such as those with
certain disorders. Through social skills therapy some of the social skills
deficit can be overcome. Social skills therapy follows behavioural principles
oflearning, for example modelling.
4. Role-playing: Role-play is a method in which a simulated situation is created
in which the client is able to practise the social skill to be enhanced. Once
effective modelling has taken place, it is recommended that role-play of
the desired behaviour is done. Role-play not only provides opportunity to
the client to practise the modelled behaviour but it is also an effective tool
for acquiring new desirable responses and unleaming the previous (undesirable)
ones. Also, through role-play, the therapist is able to assess the ability of
an individual before the therapy and train the individual in acquiring desired
response.
5. Modellirig: Modelling, also known as.observational leaming, is based on
behavioural principles of learning. It usually involves a model who
demonstrates a particular behaviour and the individual who wants to learn
the behaviour observes the model. Modelling can be done through using
live or symbolic models. Through this technique, desirable behaviours, social
skillslbehaviours can be learnt; fears can be eliminated.

1. Some of the social skills deficits faced by individuals withADHD include:
difficulty to establish and maintain friendships; inadequate social behaviours
(such as not knowing how to stand in a queue); difficulty to read the
emotional cues in conversations; difficulty in reading facial expressions; tone
of 'voice of others; blurting out answer in the class without seeking
permission.
2. Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit poor face-eye contact, exhibit odd
facial expressions; unrelated responses in the conversation; and lack of
perception of emotions in other people. r
3. Therapeutic community being a residential set-up, has members responsible
for running the unit. It provides many opportunities for developing social
and other skills. Through the setting of rules, assignment of responsibilities,
skills such as team building are fostered. Moreover, it helps making the
members independent, responsible and empowered. It also helps towards
reducing the dependency on the professionals.
