Dear Learner,
The course ‘Human Development and Family Relationships’ has 4 Credits of
theory (MCFT-001) and 2 Credits of Supervised Practicum (MCFTL-001).
The 2 credits of Supervised Practicum are divided into 8 Practicals, which
you should complete along with your theory course in the specific period of
time. This Supervised Practicum (MCFTL-001) helps you to understand better
the theoretical concepts which have been explained in the four theory Blocks of
MCFT-001. As these practicals emerge out of the theory syllabus, it would be
better to do them when you read the corresponding Units. The practical activities
will help you to get hands-on experience of working with individuals and families
in different settings.
Here, we would like you to understand that in Supervised Practicum, you have
to perform the specified activities under the overall supervision of the Academic
Counsellor, generally called Counsellor in this Block. But before starting the
practical activities, it is very important to read this Manual for Supervised
Practicum carefully. Go through the illustration of each activity in order to understand
what has to be done.
With best wishes,
Programme Coordinators

INTRODUCTION
You have to complete the Supervised Practicum (MCFTL-001) in 15 working
sessions. This Supervised Practicum is divided into 10 practicals. The practical
activities to be performed have been denoted in this Manual as Activity 1,
Activity 2 and so on. Each of your 15 working sessions for doing the
practicum should take 4 hours of a day, in which you should spend about
1 hour with the counsellor at the Programme Study Centre/Study Centre to
which you are attached and about 3 hours in fieldwork carrying out the
activity, for example, taking observations, conducting interviews etc. and
report writing.
Suggested Schedule for Supervised Practicum
It is advised that you should start the Supervised Practicum as soon as you
go through the related theory component. Before starting the practical
activities, therefore, you should devote your time to:
(i) Reading and understanding the related Units in the four Blocks of the
course Human Development and Family Relationships (MCFT-001).
(ii) Attending the counselling sessions which will be organised by the
respective Programme Study Centre/Study Centre, you are attached
with.
You have to study the theory content along with the Supervised Practicum
for the course. As you have to complete six Courses of the programme of
study Master of Science in Counselling and Family Therapy [M.Sc.(CFT)]
in the first year, or the Post Graduate Diploma in Counselling and Family
Therapy (PGDCFT), hence, it is advisable to complete the practical activities
as per the scheduled time. You are suggested to do the practicals in a
series, that is, to complete one Practicum first and then move to the next
one. Please follow the sequence of the practical activities given in the Manual,
as these are sequenced according to understanding and difficulty levels.
Duration of Supervised Practicum MCFTL-001
The Supervised Practicum comprises 10 practicals, the details of which are
given in this Manual. You have to complete these practicum in a total of
15 working days which include 15 compulsory contact classes (sessions)
with the Counsellor, each of 1 hour duration. As stated earlier, you must
spend the remaining 3 hours of each of the 15 working sessions for carrying
out field work pertaining to the eight practicals prescribed in this Manual.
The tasks of conducting the activity such as taking observations/interviews
and report writing are included in this time assigned for field work.
If the Supervised Practicum takes more time than this scheduled duration,
then you can rearrange your work accordingly, but only after discussing it
with the Supervisor/Academic Counsellor you are attached with at the
Programme Study Centre/Study Centre.
Content Layout in the Practicum Manual
This Manual for Supervised Practicum (MCFTL-001) consists of 10 practicals
which you are required to carry out. Each Practical in this Manual has
been described under three sections or parts:
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
6
Part-1: This section of each practical describes the related basic concepts
of that practical. It also explains how to conduct the activity and guides
you to the specific order in which the activity should be performed. There
are also some guidelines which would help you in the completion of that
particular practical activity.
Part-2: This section of each practical deals with the actual practical activity
that you have to perform in the field. It may consist of a check list, interview
schedule or other instructions to help you conduct the activity.
Part-3: This section of practical illustrates the conduct/analysis/recording of
the activity with the help of an illustration. For instance, if you need to take
an interview, then you have been given one filled-in interview schedule or if
you have to observe, then you have been provided a filled-in observation
checklist along with the conclusion. Please note that if you copy the
given illustration in your file, you will be failed and you would have
to repeat the entire practicals again. In any case, in the ‘Illustration’
given in each practical, the various aspects and sections have been handled
very superficially. Your report would need to be much much comprehensive,
indepth, and analytical.
You have to complete all 10 practicals for submitting the Practicum File.
Please do not copy the illustrated examples as you will be asked to resubmit
the Practicum File and this will lead to delay in award of the Degree/
Diploma. Also, do not copy from your peers/friends, as both would repeat
the whole practicum again.
Role of the Counsellor in Supervised Practicum
- The Counsellor is a qualified professional in the field, allotted by the
Programme Study Centre/Study Centre to which you are attached. The
Counsellor will supervise and guide for the Practicum Activities, during
the academic year.
- You have to spend 1 hour of each of your 15 working sessions with
the Supervisor/Counsellor, in which she or he will guide you on the
method in which the Practicum Activity has to be performed, as well
as the analysis of the same. Besides this, you can seek the help of the
Counsellor at any time during the sessions.
- The Counsellor may or may not be associated with the families you
identify for the practicum activity, but she or he can help you in identifying
the families in different settings.
- To conduct practicum activities, you have to meet the Counsellor first,
discuss the activity you are going to perform or conduct as well as the
tool (e.g., interview schedule) that you are going to use for the purpose,
take her or his advice and then visit your respondents [a person who
is being tested, interviewed or observed by you]. Here, in this programme
of study, respondent is also called ‘participant’ and at times ‘subject’.
It is advisable to report to your Counsellor after you complete each
practicum activity, and discuss what had transpired in the course of
conducting the activity.
- After completing your Practicum Activity, you need to write each and
every detail in your report. The guidelines regarding report writing are
Analysing Different
Forms of Family
7
given in every practical and the sample illustration will also represent
the way of presenting the report. If you have any problem or query
regarding report writing, then contact your Counsellor for the same.
- Apart from guiding and supervising, the Counsellor will also evaluate
your work. Thus, the Counsellor will evaluate and mark each Practical.
The evaluation mark sheet to be used is given at the end of this Manual.
Important Guidelines for Working with Individuals and Families in
Different Settings
- Identify the family/individual in desired setting carefully, as per the
instructions written in each practical activity.
- Inform the Counsellor about the selected individual/family.
- Seek the consent from the family/participant before conducting the
practicum activity. For each activity separate consent needs to be taken.
The consent form is enclosed at the end of this Manual.
- The time schedule for conducting the practicum activity should be planned
according to the convenience of the family or the individual with whom
the practical activity is to be carried out.
- Be punctual for your appointment; and if there is any change in time or
day inform the concerned family or individual.
- Try to fix the time and day, when almost every member of the family
is present at home, so that you can get information from other members
in addition to your respondent.
- Before conducting any practicum activity, you should have thorough
knowledge of its theoretical component and complete understanding of
the procedure of performing the practicum activity.
- Before starting the practicum activity, spend some time with the
respondent(s) to establish rapport and create an environment comfortable
for conversation or activity; this is generally termed as rapport building.
- Respect the views of respondents and do not interrupt or show your
own attitude, opinion or prejudice regarding what they are saying or
doing. The process should not be biased by your view points. Keep
the information confidential, and do not discuss it with any other person
including your friend, spouse, parents and other family members.
- In case the family or the individual does not cooperate with you, or
you feel that you are not getting the desired information, try to improve
the rapport building and make your questions clearer. If it does not
work, stop the activity politely and take their leave. And, report this in
your file. Also, find another respondent to carry out your practical.
Important Points for Writing a Report
1. Basic Information
Please mention all relevant details of your student status (enrolment number,
study centre etc.) clearly on each Practicum Report, as well as on the cover
of the Supervised Practicum File. The File should be presentable and legibly
written. Attach all other materials in the File (audio tapes, CDs, sheets of
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
8
paper on which you had taken notes during the interview etc.) and list each
one of them as ‘enclosures’ in the File along with the number of such items.
2. Content
In most of the practicals, one has to give information about the individual/
family and its members. As you would realise, others (especially your
evaluators!) would not have access to this information unless you provide
the same in the report of the Practicum! So do remember to provide all
relevant information. At the same time, be true to yourself as you are
learning important concepts from the practicum activity. Do not falsify the
report or modify the record of the practicum activity to make it look ‘good’.
Don’t worry if everything in the family does not fit a given, stereotypical
norm of a family or a relationship. The idea here is to move away from
being judgemental and learn to create a view that is unbiased, encompassing
and sensitive to plurality. Your evaluations are going to be based on an
objective and unbiased treatment of the same in analysis. Please use the
concepts you have learnt in the Course in order to meet this end.
The content of your file will also be evaluated on how comprehensively and
objectively you have dealt with the issues at hand. Your personal beliefs and
preconceived notions should not hinder the understanding of the content.
For example, one may believe in the sanctity of the ‘ideal’ Indian joint
family but in your writing do not undermine other forms of family. Rather
focus on how these families achieve some goals, write about their needs and
document the positive forces in relationships.
3. Presentation
Be creative. Try to make the Practicum activity interesting by using different
strategies. In tasks that have scope, use innovative methods to highlight
some aspects or draw attention to some salient features of the family. But,
a word of caution — do not beautify the files for no reason. Use your
energies to refine and make the content meaningful. Be organised and help
the evaluator know that you have understood the concepts. Use pseudonyms
rather than the actual names for the respondent and family members. But
rest of the information should be truthful.
4. Length
Give all relevant details of a situation or a person. Be careful not to beat
about the bush! The richness of content and organisation of your report
carry more weight than how many pages it consists of or how long it is! Be
organised and use keys, pictures, symbols or diagrams wherever necessary.
For more clarity, summarise each task in terms of activity conducted and
outcomes. Explain the tasks well so that your evaluator understands the
content easily.
Evaluation of Supervised Practicum File
The evaluation of Supervised Practicum is done at two levels. These are:
 Evaluation Level 1 : Internal Evaluation
 Evaluation Level 2 : External Evaluation
Evaluation Level 1: At the Programme Study Centre / Study Centre
by the Academic Counsellor/Supervisor
Analysing Different
Forms of Family
9
Every practicum activity will be evaluated by the Academic Counsellor/
Supervisor with whom you have been attached by the Programme Study
Centre/Study Centre for the Supervised Practicum component of this Course.
For the purpose of evaluation, for each practical, the Academic Counsellor
will judge your performance during interactive sessions and evaluate the
written records which have been submitted by you in the Supervised
Practicum File. This is called Internal Evaluation.
The marking scheme is as follows:
Maximum marks (MM) for each practical = 40
Break-up
MM for the interactive session(s) for the practical = 10
MM for the written record of the practical for the Practical File = 30
Hence, total MM for the internal evaluation component of the
Supervised Practicum (all 10 practicals) is 400.
Supervised Practicum File
The Supervised Practicum File will be prepared by compiling the written
records of all the ten practicals. You have to submit the complete Practicum
File duly evaluated by your Practicum Supervisor at your Programme Study
Centre/Study Centre, before the mentioned due date. The File would contain
sheets on which you have written the report of each practical duly, evaluated
by the Academic Counsellor, and the filled-in evaluation sheet given at
‘Annexure A’ at the end of this Manual.
The Counsellor will record the marks that you have obtained for the Practicum
at the end of each practical in your Supevised Practicum File, and in
Section 1 of the mark sheet provided at the end of this Manual at
Annexure A. Sections 2 & 3 of Annexure A have to be left blank, as these
are to be filled-in by the External Evaluator.
This Annexure A with duly filled in Section 1 and blank Sections 2 & 3
must be included in the Supervised Practicum File that you submit.
In addition, the Counsellor will certify the Form given at Annexure B at the
end this Supervised Practicum Manual which declares that every practicum
activity was conducted by you for the required duration under her or his
supervision at the location which was approved by the Programme Study
Centre/ Study Centre. You must also include this duly filled-in Annexure B
in the File you submit.
Evaluation Level 2: External Evaluation (Evaluation of Practicum
File at IGNOU Headquarters).
An expert from the panel, nominated by IGNOU, will evaluate the
Supervised Practicum File. This is called External Evaluation. The External
Evaluator will record the marks in Sections 2 and 3 of Annexure A of this
Supervised Practicum Manual, that you would have enclosed in the File.
External evaluation will therefore be done on the basis of the Supervised
Practicum File submitted by the learner.
The External Evaluator shall evaluate each practical out of 40 marks.
Thus, the total marks for the external evaluation component shall
be 400.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum

Weightage of Two Levels of Evaluation
The two levels of evaluation carry equal weightage towards final marks:
 The marks given by the Supervisor at Level 1, known as ‘Internal
Assesment, will be calculated as 50% weightage; and
 The marks given by the expert at Level 2, known as ‘External
Assessment’, will also be calculated as 50% weightage.
You have to secure 40% as pass marks in both the assessments, internal as
well as external. If you are not able to secure 40% marks in either
assessment, you have to repeat the complete Supervised Practicum MCFTL001. It means you have to re-do all the Practicum Activities, make a new
Practicum File and submit it.
Note: The panel of experts nominated by IGNOU, who are going to
evaluate your Practicum File have the right to moderate the Internal
Assessment marks awarded through the Programme Study Centre / Study
Centre in any component of the Practicum.
Submission of Supervised Practicum File
The complete Practicum File may be sent to the following address:

Maximum Duration of the Practicum
For 2 credit Supervised Practicum of this Course, you have to spent 15
sessions of which one hour is with your Counsellor or Supervisor and 3
hours are to be devoted to the field work. The maximum time you can take
to complete the practicum is four months from the date of commencement
of the Supervised Practicum for this Course.

Illustration1: Analysing Different Forms of Family
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The family development perspective in its original form assumed that family
structure and family life follow certain conventional patterns. The conventional
patterns such as couples marry and marriage precedes parenthood, all families
have children, parents remain together for a life time, husbands are employed
but wives are not, were almost norms of living. However, these typical
features of family are changing in the contemporary world and newer family
forms such as single parent families, women headed households, childless
families, adoptive families and dual earner families are increasingly seen
around. In order to know more about the diversities in family forms you will
now have to engage in practical work. The aim of this practical is to
critically analyse different types of families in the contemporary context with
respect to characteristics, needs, structure, roles and relationships,
communication patterns, hierarchy and decision making, crisis, disagreements,
adaptation and cohesiveness.
Objectives:
After undertaking this Practical, you will be able to:
 Understand the different types of family existing in the society;
 Get indepth understanding of the selected family types;
 Differentiate between the needs of various members along with their
roles and relationships; and
 Appreciate the importance of having knowledge of family structures
and their varied characteristics for practising family therapy.

1.2 PART-1
1.2.1 Family Forms in India
Before conducting the practicum activity let us quickly review the forms of
family that we have learnt in Unit 6 in Block 1. The nuclear family is a basic
unit of family which includes a husband, wife and their children, either
biological or adopted. The other type of family which is very common in
India is extended or joint family. In these types three or more generations
live together with both vertical and lateral extensions and have a single line
of authority. But specifically we can define joint family as a group of people
who generally live under one roof, eat food cooked at one hearth, hold
property in common, participate in common family worship and are related
to each other. In an extended family, several generations of one family live
together sharing home and extended family activities. At times, members of
the larger family come and stay with their relatives.
For the purpose of this Practical we have classified these types of family
into two groups. In Group 1 we would analyse the types of families mentioned
above. In Group 2 we have some alternate forms of family. These are single
parent families, women headed households, childless families, reconstituted/
step families or migrant families. Let us discuss these families in brief here.
Single parent families are those families in which the children reside with one
parent, who shoulders the major responsibility of their upbringing. Women
headed households may also be single parent families headed by women.
Childlessness refers to a person, couple or family that does not have any
children. In adoptive families, childless couples adopt a child or children
from known or unknown backgrounds. Dual earner families are those in
which wife and husband pursue uninterrupted life long careers while
establishing and developing a family life-style that often includes children.
Reconstituted or step families are families which are formed through remarriage
after divorce or widowhood. In step families, both the husband and the wife
or at least one of them has children from previous marriage. Migrant families
are those who move from one location to another.
1.2.2 Interview as a Method
The information required to complete this activity is to be collected with the
help of an interview. The given interview schedule is to be used to collect
the information regarding various needs, roles, relationships, hierarchy,
communication patterns, decision making and cohesiveness of selected family
types.
Some important guidelines for conducting the interview:
1. Before conducting the interview, build rapport with the respondent.
2. While conducting the interview, the order of questions can be changed
according to the situation. You may also modify questions and add
more questions.
3. Use simple language. Preferably, ask questions in the local language.
4. Do not ask personal questions and be specific to the information
required.
Analysing Different
Forms of Family
15
5. Do not ever show your opinion or attitude regarding the question.
6. Be patient while the respondent is replying. Give him or her enough
time to respond.
7. Listen carefully and take notes or do the audio-recording of the
interview.
Important points to remember before conducting the interview:
 The interviewer, apart from the manifest content, must pay attention to
the latent or the hidden content.
 The interviewer should listen not only to what a person wants to say,
but also to what the respondent does not want to say or cannot say
without help.
 The interviewer must be careful and sensitive when the conversation
deals with the crisis in the family of the individual. The respondent may
become emotional and may not want to continue with the topic. The
interviewer should drop the issue for the time being and another line of
conversation may be pursued. If required, a less direct approach may
be taken for the sensitive subject.

dual-earner family; woman headed household, migrant family or adoptive
family.
2. Identify one person from each of the two family types you have selected
and ask them if they would be willing to participate in an interview with
you about their family. You may wish to assure them that their responses
or answers in the interview would be kept confidential.
3. The selected person could be any adult member of the family irrespective
of gender and family role.
4. Set up a mutually convenient time with them to conduct the interview.
You can meet the person more than once to conduct the interview, if
you or they run out of time.
5. Use the given interview schedule to conduct the interview. Remember,
the schedule is only a broad guideline. If need be, you can ask more
questions or probe further in order to get detailed and complete
information about a topic in the interview.
6. Be sensitive to your respondents. Some of them may want to take
some time to think about the questions.
7. You can also change the order of some sections in the interview,
depending on how the conversation between you and the respondent
progresses. So for example, if you are discussing family needs and the
respondent has already begun sharing about hierarchy or cohesiveness,
you may want to discuss those questions first, rather than sticking to
the given format.
8. On an average, the interview should take about 1½ - 2 hours.
9. You must try to record or document the responses you gathered in the
interview for future reference, especially when you write the report for
this practical. So you may want to write down verbatim what your
respondents said in response to the questions you asked. You may use
a tape recorder for recording purpose, after seeking permission from
the respondent. Subsequently, you may transcribe (write on paper) the
recorded interview.
10. Your report for this practical should include your reflections about the
similarities and differences in the two chosen families. Refer to the
instructions given later for analysis and report writing for the same.

Give your analysis and discussion; conclusions; and reflections with respect
to each interview before proceeding to doing the same with respect to the
comparative study of the two families selected.
In this course of interpretation, analysis, and discussion, try and relate what
has emerged from the interviews to the theoretical concepts and the Course
content.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:
___________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________
In this section, you have to compare the similarities and differences between
the two families you have chosen with reference to:
 Family composition (Structure and number of members)
 The roles and responsibilities of different members of the family
 Gendered division of labour in the family (is the work distributed
depending on the person’s gender?)
 Resources available to the family (material and socio-emotional resources)
 Different strategies used for communication, resolving disagreements and
overcoming crisis and their effectiveness with reference to the context.
CONCLUSIONS BASED ON COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS:
___________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________
___________________________________________________________
Begin the report with an introduction of the Practicum activity conducted by
you. Your report will consist of the composition of the selected families, the
roles, responsibilities and needs of the members, the communication patterns
and conflict resolution techniques. You can write your report picking up
each point and comparing the two family types. The report should run into
at least two thousand words. Your report must have analysis and discussion
components which will enable better understanding of each family and its
varied components as well as a comparative, insightful overview. You may
refer to the Units you have studied so far to enable appropriate analysis and
reporting. Your report should also have concluding remarks about whether
the exercise helped you gain insight into the family types you chose to study.

1.4 PART-3
1.4.1 Analyzing Different Forms of Family
AIM:
To understand different types of family forms existing in the society.
OBJECTIVES:
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Understand the different types of family existing in the society;
 Get indepth understanding of the selected family types;
 Differentiate between the needs of various members along with their
roles and relationships; and
 Appreciate the importance of having knowledge of family structures
and their varied characteristics for practising family therapy.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Interview schedule, pen, paper, tape recorder.
Proceduer:
I selected a joint family from Group I, from a slum area in a city. The
respondent was a mother living in a dwelling along with her husband, motherin-law and three children.
I contacted the mother and fixed up a convenient time for the interview. The
lady, Asha gave me an afternoon time (as she is comparatively free having
completed the morning chores). I reached on the time decided upon. I
established a rapport with her for 10-15 minutes before starting the formal
interview. I got important information during the initial rapport building chat,
which I noted down.
Findings:
Background information:
 Name of the respondent : Asha Sharma
 Age: 41 years
 Sex: F (female)
 Family Income: Rs. 5000/- (per month)
 Type of Family: Joint
 Number of family members: Six (including Asha)
 Their age and relationship to the respondent : Give complete details
here.
Specific Information
1) With reference to each family member, and yourself, list at least
two personal-emotional and physical-material needs.
(Note down Asha’s response verbatim)
Analysing Different
Forms of Family
23
My mother-in-law needs help and care while moving as she has knee
problem. She constantly needs to talk and so one of us has to give her
a patient hearing. It can be irritating sometimes but since she is a
member of the family we have to do so... She also needs some medicine
to control her blood pressure which we get from the government clinic.
In the amount that my husband earns it is difficult to fulfill the needs of
all the members.
My children need love, care, and attention constantly, especially the
youngest son who is seven years old. They need proper food as they
are growing up... They all go to the government school so providing
them the necessary books, bags etc. is taxing. I do wish to send my
sons for higher education but financially it may become a burden.
My husband needs …
I need ...
2) With reference to each family member, identify two roles they
are playing and their corresponding responsibilities. State the same
for yourself too.
I am all the time playing the role of a mother and wife. It is my
responsibility to cook, wash vessels, clothes, clean the house, send the
children to school on time, prepare tiffin for my husband and many
such tasks which I do daily.
My husband is the only earning member; he has to go to the factory
and work. He also has to look after the deteriorating health of his
mother as he is the only son (he has 4 sisters who all are married).
Mother-in-law…(In this way you have to write about each family
member’s roles and responsibilities.)
3) Decision Making
a) Who takes decisions in the family with regard to the following
aspects and why? Why are you not involved in the decision
making?
b) What is your role in decision making and what do you keep
in mind while taking decisions?
 Socio-religious aspects: Both my mother-in-law and I decide
about the religious aspects. When my father-in-law was alive
we would do poojas (rituals, prayers) and fast together but
now mostly I get involved more than my mother-in-law. She
does give her advice on religious matters. Sometimes she puts
undue pressure on me to perform certain rituals and to call
upon neighbours and relatives living close by. I try to comply
but on several occasions we end up arguing and have verbal
fights.
 Financial aspects: My husband and I decide on the
expenditure; we are not able to save anything as the income
is meagre. My husband also has habit of tobacco but since he
earns I do not have much say in it. (You may want to probe
further if you think Asha is willing to reveal).
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
24
 Domestic/Household related aspects: I take the maximum
decisions related to household aspects. There are occasions
when my mother-in-law also has a say but otherwise I am the
person handling the domestic things.
 Education/Career related aspects: Since our children are
very young both my husband and I discuss their educational
prospects, but if our financial condition improves we may be
able to provide a good education to our children.
4) a) Describe a situation where you or any other family member(s)
have been able to communicate effectively within the family.
Identify the reasons for the same.
When my father-in-law expired due to an illness, my mother-inlaw was angry and resentful as she felt that better medical facilities
could have saved his life and somewhere she blamed my husband
and me for it. At times she also took the blame on herself. During
those days I did not shut down communication, in fact I made
efforts to get her involved in children’s activities and continuously
reassured her that she has been a successful mother and wife.
Gradually, her resentment reduced and she could overcome the
grief in some months.
b) Describe a situation where communication in the family
failed or was not effective. Identify the reasons for the same.
About couple of years back my husband was unemployed for a
few months; he had become irritable and would get angry on
every family member. Inspite of constantly trying to get some job
he was unable to do so. Due to loss of family income he would
interact with us only if necessary. I tried to reach out to him but
was unable to do so as he blamed himself for the situation we
were facing. We were also under tremendous tension as the monthly
income had stopped. During these troubled times communication
within the family had failed and my continuous efforts to talk to
him were ineffective. I would also lose my temper often and it
would be the children who had to bear the brunt of it. It was only
after gainful employment that our communication got back to normal.
The reason for such tension was joblessness and my husband’s
feelings that he is incapable of taking care of his family. We were
not able to cope well with the condition; I think if I was able to
earn some money at that time we may have been able to face the
situation without the undue pressure on us.
5) a) List down the names of family members in descending order
(highest to lowest) with respect to their age. Rank the
members in terms of power in decision making and providing
emotional support.

3. Asha (44 years) 2 1
4. Son (12 years) 4 5
5. Daughter (10 years) 5 4
6. Son (7 years) 6 6
6) Describe any crisis/disagreements among family members and
discuss the strategies used to resolve the same.
Like I mentioned that the time when my husband did not have a job,
it was a crisis situation. Financially we were affected so much that it
was the major cause of all the fights. Moreover, even socially the
neighbours and relatives had started labeling us. Further my husband’s
inability to handle the situation made it difficult for all the family members.
I did try to keep my cool and make sure that I encourage my husband
to try to get some job even if the money was less than what he earned
earlier. My mother-in-law too would try to support by talking to him
and always told him to have faith in God. I think we were able to sail
through that phase without my husband taking up any vices (like many
men in our neighbourhood are addicted to).
7) Describe a situation where you experienced emotional warmth /
support from your family [or any particular member(s)] or
instances where you provided the same to others.
When my youngest son was born I was asked to take rest as I did not
have a normal delivery. I was apprehensive about managing things at
the home front but to my surprise my mother-in-law supported me and
took care of everything. Even my husband took care of the kids
whenever he was at home. My mother-in-law also cared a lot for my
health; she would make sure I do not strain myself. She was affectionate
and caring; I am indebted to her for the support she gave me.
ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION
Write these as explained in the description of the practical (Part-2).
CONCLUSIONS:
I noted that throughout the interview there is dissatisfaction voiced by Asha
about the various expectations and pressures she has had to face. Yet there
are ways of dealing with the problems mentioned by her. The respondent
was candid and expressive. I was able to gather vast information. The
financial condition of the family was not good. Asha has to take care of her
mother-in-law and other family members. She works all the day and is
trying hard to improve the condition of family. She want to educate her
children. Although she takes good care of her mother-in-law and respects
her, yet she is not happy with her nagging nature. She has faith in God and
believes that he would improve their living condition some day.

The whole process was very interesting and I learned about the additional
responsibilities of joint family and also the support provided by elder members
of joint family.
REFLECTIONS:
I selected joint family from Group 1. To complete this practicum activity I
decided to take interview of one member of that joint family who lives in
a slum area. I approached the lady of that house and told her about the
practicum activity and information required from her. She had doubts which
I cleared and then she happily agreed to give the interview. We decided a
day and fixed a time for this activity. I reached there on time and interviewed
her. The whole process took one hour. I noted down the information given
by her. I thanked her and took her leave. After I came home, I wrote the
report.
Note: Similarly you would select a family type from Group 2 and conduct
a similar interview with a respondent from that family. For example,
take a dual-career family. The responses gathered from both the
interviews will give you a view of the composition of each family, the
needs of its members, their roles and responsibilities along with the
communication patterns, gendered role division, decision making powers
and methods used to resolve conflict. Then, finally compare the two
groups of families.

Illustration 1 : Understanding Roles and Responsibilities of Family Members
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Having read the theory Blocks of this Course, you have basic information about
human development, family, interpersonal relationships and factors that influence
these. You are also aware of the family structures (traditional and alternative),
functions and basic processes that determine dynamics among family members
and society at large. With the help of this information you are now able to identify
the challenges they face and their psycho-social needs.
This particular practical experience has been designed such that you can relate the
concepts of family functions, roles, responsibilities and cohesiveness to family life.
To become an effective counsellor and family therapist you must develop skills of
communication, analysis and sensitivity to clients from different backgrounds. It is
also important for you to develop the ability of objectively reflecting on life events
and episodes that influence individuals and families. In order to get an in-depth
understanding of these processes, it is of value that you begin with the study of
family. It will help you to become aware of roles and responsibilities of the family
members and have a better understanding of the same.
The aim of this exercise is to build your competencies such that you understand
the family as a functioning unit and take perspectives of the respondent as well
as other members involved. You are required to draw from the theoretical concepts
discussed in the theory Units and understand the family situations as a professional
counsellor and family therapist. This will help you in developing sensitivity to
diverse conditions that affect family members and family development.
You may need to refer to the theory course materials intermittently while writing
up this exercise.
27
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
28
Objectives:
After undertaking this Practical, you will be able to:
 Identify strengths and weaknesses in the family members in a family context;
and
 Describe one’s role in the family with respect to relationships, work allocation
and resource sharing.
2.2 PART-1
2.2.1 Planning for the Practicum Activity
Because this exercise is with a family, you have to take prior appointment before
starting the practicum activity. Do not begin doing the practical activities before
you have finished the theory Blocks of the Course. Remember, this activity has
to do with family members and analysis of the family processes. So, the more you
think about it consciously and objectively (without any preconceived notions or
beliefs) the better will the product be!
 Pre-preparation
The Practicum activity is divided into two phases with one task in each phase. As
this Practicum activity is interpretive in nature (involving more thinking and
organisation of thoughts and ideas), you should begin thinking of all the tasks in
advance, at least a week or two before actually executing the tasks.
At the end of each phase, keep in mind that you must have some written record
of the whole experience and your thoughts on it. You may jot these down as bullet
points also.
Now, we move to how you and the respondent’s family should be involved in the
tasks.
 Your Involvement and Perspective
Start taking information about the respondent’s family in terms of the relationships
shared, its overall composition, unique aspects and lacunae. You will also need to
ask about family member’s role and position in the family very consciously. Begin
evaluating the respondent’s role in the family and start making notes. These will
help you write the final report. You may also wish to write down some events and
episodes from everyday life that made you think of theoretical concepts in the
Course. Try to match your records of events and relationships with the content
in the Units. You will be surprised to know how interesting the whole process
becomes! Make notes of the similarities of the respondent’s family life experiences
with the Course content. There may also be differences and you must highlight
them in the report. Be sure to refer to theoretical concepts of the Course in the
interpretation or analysis parts of your report.
 Overview of the Practical
This Practicum activity requires you to carry out tasks in two phases; each phase
has one task in it. They are listed below along with the format in which you are
required to submit them. Use of these given formats would help you organise
your material systematically. Better organisation and clarity definitely fetches more
marks.

2.3.1 Understanding Roles and Responsibilities of Family
Members
AIM:
To understand the family as a functioning unit by discovering the roles and
responsibilities of family members.
OBJECTIVES:
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Identify strengths and weaknesses in the family members in a family context;
and
 Describe one’s role in the family with respect to relationships, work allocation
and resource sharing.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Pen, pencil, paper, or tape recorder.
Procedure:
This Practicum activity is divided into two phases:
Phase 1 : Interviewing the Respondent
Phase 2 : Drawing of Venn Diagram
Identify the family and approach the head or any adult member of the family. Ask
him or her if he or she would be willing to participate in an interview with you
about his or her family. You may wish to assure the respondent that his or her
responses or answers in the interview would be kept confidential. Set up a
mutually convenient time with the respondent to conduct the interview. You can
meet the person more than once to conduct the interview, if you or the respondent
run out of time. Start taking information about the respondent’s family in terms of
the relationships shared, overall composition, unique aspects and lacunae. You will
also need to ask about each family member’s roles, responsibilities and position
in the family.
PHASE 1: Interview
Tool used : Interview Schedule
You are required to seek the required information and note down each and every
word that a respondent will narrate to you. You may also choose to do an audiorecording of the interview and later transcribe the same. Do not forget to prepare
a set of questions or the interview schedule before hand.
This interview schedule should be included in your recording of the practicum in
the File.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
30
You may rephrase the questions if required during the interview and the same
should be noted in your practicum. Also, you can further probe the respondent,
if required and the same should also be recorded.
You must include the interview schedule that you prepared and the
modifications you brought in during the interview, in the final report of this
practicum included in the File.
FINDINGS
 Describe the respondent in the family. Mention the roles the respondent
plays and the contributions (material and emotional) he or she makes in the
family.

with her mother-in-law. I approached her and discussed about her participation
in the practicum activity. Firstly, she hesitated, but after seeing my practicum
manual and some discussion regarding the programme [M.Sc.(CFT)], she was
convinced and gave her consent for this practicum activity. But she did not want
to mention her and other family members’ name, hence in practicum report I have
changed the original name of respondent. We decided Monday 7th June, 2010 for
this practicum activity. I reached her place on time. She had done daily household
chores and had enough free time to provide me the information required for this
activity. After some informal talks, I started asking her questions related to herself,
her roles and responsibilities in the house. Then I asked about the other family
members, their roles and responsibilities in the family. It took about 90-120
minutes to get whole information. I noted down each and every information on
paper. After completion of this activity she offered me tea. I thanked her for her
cooperation and hospitality and took her leave.
FINDINGS:
Tool Used and Responses Obtained:
Here you have to write (1) the interview schedule prepared by you, (2) the
actual verbatim of the interview - both the questions asked and the answers.
I am presenting the roles and responsibilities of each family member in two ways,
these are simply in word format and through Venn diagram. Let us see the first
method of presenting the roles and responsibilities of each family member.

PHASE 1: Meet the Respondent’s Family
Name: Meera
About Meera: Meera has short height and dark complexion. She is a very
helpful person. She has the good quality of being very patient and calm. She does
not get angry easily. Before taking any decision, she likes to think about all the
pros and cons.
Age: 35 years Sex: Female
Roles played and relationships shared in the family: She is a housewife,
mother and daughter-in-law in her family of procreation. She has two children.
She is married to a businessman; he has a shop of his own. They have their own
house in Patna. In her family of procreation, she is the eldest daughter-in-law. She
has one younger brother-in-law who got married last year and lives separately.
Sometimes, she also helps her husband in his shop. She has two children; eldest
is daughter, who is 10 years of age named Shyama and a 3 year old son named
Abhishek. Her daughter goes to school and her son is at home yet.
Contributions to family: She provides emotional support to her family and
responds to their needs, for example when children need to share something with
her, she gives them time and a patient hearing. She also contributes to the family
by helping her husband in his business so she gives some financial support also.
She has a lot of responsibilities at home (like child care, kitchen chores, managing
finances etc.) and executing them properly is a goal for her.
Her strengths: She has the ability to motivate and care for others, like her
children and other family members, e.g. her mother-in-law. She is also good at
managing finances and family income. She keeps all the expenses in check and
uses the money after planning for the future. She emphasises discipline with
children.
Her weaknesses: She can get upset easily over petty matters, is short tempered,
and often cannot communicate her worries frankly.
Her mother-in-law’s strength: She has kept the family together, has foresight.
Her mother-in-law’s weaknesses: If she gets annoyed, it is difficult to please
her. She is not willing to accommodate newer views of younger members.
Shyama’s strength: Her daughter is very beautiful, as she has taken on her
‘Dadi’ (grand mother). She is very helpful and responsible. She does her homework
independently and on time. She likes to play outdoor games.
Shyama’s weaknesses: She has to be coaxed to eat, is very fussy in
eating…especially fruits and vegetables. She hates drinking milk!!
Abhishek’s strengths: He is not a very demanding child, very playful. He can
be taken care of by anyone in the family.
Abhishek’s weakness: He can be very adamant (ziddi) at times.
Similarly, you have to write for all the other family members.

PHASE 2 : Venn Diagram
INTERPRETATION OF THE VENN DIAGRAM
For ease in interpretation, the family members are given numbers which are
denoting the closest relationship and moving on to the farthest. The distance is
indicated from the length of the arrows. The above diagram shows that Meera
is emotionally closest to her daughter. This is followed by her husband. She does
not experience too much emotional closeness to her mother-in-law.
Reasons for closeness or distance
Daughter: Meera as a mother knows her very well. She understands her perfectly
like no one else can. She comes to know of her needs even before she tells her.
There is a strong bond between them. She is extremely caring and protective.
Husband: They are almost of the same age and earlier were in college together.
They are almost like friends. Meera shares everything about herself with him. He
understands Meera very well and is extremely helpful during any crisis situation.
Son: Meera’s son is very adament. He often stays with his dadi (paternal
grandmother). He loves his mother but does not express it often. At times Meera
cannot judge what his reactions would be to Meera’s behaviours.
Mother-in-law: Meera’s mother-in-law and Meera do not get along too well.
They are pleasant to each other but she does not approve of many things Meera
does. On occasion, she complains about Meera to her mother and compares
Meera with her daughter.
Note: You can add concentric circles to the family relationships also. The
first circle in the middle indicating the closest relationships followed by
other, wider circles encompassing the one in the centre.

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION; CONCLUSION
These are to be written as explained in the description of the Practical
(Part-2)
REFLECTIONS:
This practicum activity is aimed at understanding the family as a functioning unit
by discovering the roles and responsibilites of family members. I selected a family
in my neighbourhood to get the information needed in this practicum activity. I
approached Mrs. Meera and after some hesitation she agreed to become a part
of this activity. We fixed a date and time. I reached at her place on time and
gathered all the information that was required for the completion of this activity.
Mrs. Meera is very co-operative and humble lady. I have presented the information
given by her in two methods. I simply noted down the roles and responsibilities
of each family member and then drew a Venn diagram on the basis of the
information. It is found that Mrs. Meera is very close to her daughter and husband.
She didn’t like her mother-in-law, as she always compared her (Meera) with her
own daughter. I found this activity very interesting and acquired a better
understanding of roles and responsibilities of family members.

Illustration 1: Observation of Human Life Stages
3.1 INTRODUCTION
This practicum activity involves observing individuals in different stages of life,
for example, infants, preschoolers, school going children, adolescents and
adults. For this purpose, you will be required to make observations of
individuals of different age groups and understand their developmental
characteristics in accordance to their age. The subsequent sections of this
practicum activity will provide you the details about what is involved in the
preparation, evaluation and written report of this practicum.
Objectives
After undertaking this Practical, you will be able to:
 Recognise the different stages of human life span; and
 Identify the various developmental characteristics of different life stages.
3.2 PART-1
3.2.1 Observation as a Scientific Technique
Some investigations deal with individuals who are not able to give verbal
reports of either their behaviour or their feelings for the simple reason that
they cannot speak, for example infants. In that case we use one of the
scientific methods known as observation.
Observation can be defined as an information-gathering technique which is
based on personal or recorded observation, through systematic documentation
of visible social activity and behaviour.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
38
Observation is a primary tool of scientific inquiry. Observation becomes a
scientific technique if it :
1. Serves a formulated research purpose,
2. Is planned systematically,
3. Is recorded systematically and related to more general propositions
rather than being presented as an event of interesting curiosity, and
4. Is subjected to checks and controls of validity and reliability.
Types of Observations
Let us now take a look at the major types of observation methods that are
commonly used:
i) Narratives - In this case, the observer records all that happens during
to the time period of observation. Narratives are of five types:
a) Dairy description : This method is used to gather data over a
prolonged time period. It is one of the oldest methods of studying
the behaviour especially of young children. This method helps the
parent/counsellor to help children who are aggressive, passive or
withdrawn etc. A chronological record is maintained.
b) Anecdotal records : It is recording the behaviour after it occurs.
Parents used to record detailed information after occurrence of the
event/behaviour. Anecdotal records help the counsellor and family
therapist in planning for the individual and family.
c) Running record : It is recorded while the behaviour is occurring.
It is recorded in sequence. This again would help the counsellor and
family therapist to decide the future course of action.
d) Specimen description: It is recording while the behaviour is
occurring of an already identified situation. This helps to analyse
cause and effect relationship. For example, physical aggression.
e) Log or journal - It is recoring in brief about details of all the group/
family members. This is done after the behaviour occurs. This would
help the counsellor and family therapist to keep a record of the
status and progress of all inividuals in the family.
ii) Time sampling observation: Time sampling observation method is
used where an aspect of behaviour is observed. It involves observing the
person(s) for an extended period such as a whole morning or afternoon
session, or even a whole day. The observation is time bound (for
example 30 seconds or 1 minute) and is done at regular intervals (for
example every 10 minutes or every hour) about what a particular individual
(or group of individuals) is (are) doing.
The advantages of this technique are:
 It helps in observing a person’s overall behaviour and a person’s
particular behaviour during the course of a day.
Observation of
Human Life Stages
39
 It helps in identifying a selected aspect of behaviour by revealing the
frequency of that behaviour.
This technique has a disadvantage also, as the observer gets tied to
watching the clock and being restricted to only recording events that
happen in the predetermined period. The aim should be well-defined for
this type of observation as without an aim and focus no useful conclusion
can be drawn.
iii) Event sampling observation: Event sampling observation is used to
collect information from a stream of events. It focuses on a particular
short span of behaviour; especially the event in which observer is interested.
The observation is not time bound as the observation depends on the
time period of the event. It is generally used to observe aspects such as
aggressive behaviour, quarrels, attention seeking behaviour etc.
The main disadvantage of this method is that it is very difficult to be alert all
the time and ready to record the event.
3.2.2 Overview of this Practical
Let us now have an overview of what it is that you are required to do during
this practicum.
During this practical, you will be observing three individuals at different life
stages. The duration of the observations will depend upon the type of
observations to be made. You may be required to make additional observations
of the same individual if the observations do not yield substantial information
about the developmental characteristics of that particular life stage.
Perhaps the greatest asset of observational techniques is that they make it
possible to record behaviour as it occurs. Always remember, many forms of
behaviours are so much taken for granted by the observer as these behaviours
may be “natural” in some social group/culture to the extent that they escape
awareness and resist translation into words by the observer.
3.2.4 Principles To Be Kept In Mind During
Observations
Observe and record each activity carried out by the individual who is being
observed. Observe the interaction between the individual being observed and
any other person in the setting, for example, interaction between the infant
and the parent, or adolescent and his or her friends. Note down specific
instances of interactions.
Recording the Observation
While recording the observation, two questions need to be considered :
1. When should the observer make notes?
2. How should notes be kept?
The best time for recording is undoubtedly on the spot and during the event.
This results in a minimum of selective bias and distortion through memory.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
40
Record your immediate impressions and write up, as soon as possible after
a period of observation, a complete account of everything in the situation that
you wish to remember.
It is always helpful to keep a record of the number and date of observation,
names of persons observed, and a brief summary of what is covered in the
notes.
Procedure to Ensure Accuracy of Observations
 In order to ensure the accuracy of the observations, you may specify
which statements refer to actual events and which are your own
interpretations. Keep a full record of the observations.
 A full record of observations helps in maintaining the objectivity of the
observer.
 Do not take things for granted. Make frequent recordings, cross-check
the observation by reporting to an outsider.
 Sometimes focusing on individuals who do not appear to be central in the
group gives new insights about important relationships.
3.3 PART-2
Observation of Human Life Stages
AIM:
To observe the various human life stages.
Objectives:
After undertaking this Practical, you will be able to:
 Recognise the different stages of human life span; and
 Identify the various developmental characteristics of different life stages.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Paper, pen, pencil, clock.
Procedure:
In this practicum, you have to carry out observations with respect to two
individuals. Before beginning this practicum activity, it is a pre-requisite that
you must have understood the stages of human life span given in Unit 1 of
Block 1.
1. To begin with this practicum, you have to identify from the given options,
at least two settings as well as individuals whom you would be observing:
 Setting 1: Preschools, day-care centres, crèches, primary schools or
parks.
 Setting 2: Youth clubs, hobby classes for adolescents, camps for
youth, career coaching sessions, counselling sessions of schools.
Observation of
Human Life Stages
41
 Setting 3: Old age home, Mahila Mandal meetings, Vocational classes
for adults, adult education institutions.
2. Visit the setting (organization, institution, school etc.) and seek permission
from the concerned person to conduct the practicum activity.
3. Do not forget to take prior consent of the individual and guardian/parents
of children for the observations that you would be making.
4. Fix appointments with the relevant persons concerned for the convenient
time for observation.
5. Follow the schedule and reach on time.
6. Observe the individual by using one or more of the various methods
(discussed in practical Part-1) and note down the observations.
7. Make a record, focussing particularly on the analysis, discussion, and
conclusion.
8. Prepare the report in prescribed format.
Repeat the above procedure to record observation of the second individual
you have identified in a specified setting. In doing this practical, try and get
a feel of a variety of methods of observation listed in Part-1.
FINDINGS:
In this section you have to elaborate upon the recordings that you have made
during each of the three observation. You have to write exactly the same
behaviour, interaction, movements etc. that you have seen during observation,
that is, you do not have to add your opinion or inferences in this section.
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:
In this section you have to write down your inference and analysis of the
observations you have made about the individual. Analyze the behaviour and
characteristics of the individual and try to relate it with the characteristics of
that particular stage of life/family development you have read in course
content.
The analysis and discussion may be done for observations of each of the
individuals (belonging to different life stages). Thereafter, you may present a
comparative study.

Observation of Human Life Stages
AIM:
To observe the various human life span stages.
OBJECTIVES:
After undertaking this Practical, you will be able to:
 Recognise the different stages of human life span; and
 Identify the various developmental characteristics of different life stages.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Paper, pen, pencil, note-pad
Procedure:
I identified Sanskriti Play School near my house as a setting for observing the
preschool stage of human life span. I met Mrs. Suparna Kailash who was the
principal of that school and described my purpose of observation to seek the
permission to conduct practicum activity. She happily permitted me. I identified
Seeta a girl child 3 years of age for observation to understand the preschool
stage of human life span. I met Seeta’s mother when she came to drop her
child and then took her consent to observe her child. We fixed Tuesday, 25th
May 2010 for observation. I reached exactly at 08:30 am in Sanskriti Play
School. I selected dairy description method of observation to observe the
child.
FINDINGS:
Name of the child: Seeta
Age: 3 years
Time of Observation: 9.00 am.
Date: 25-05-10
Duration of time: 20 minutes
During free play, three year old Seeta came to the table where children were
cutting and pasting pieces of coloured paper. She watched for a while, then
picked up some scissors and a piece of paper and tried to cut it. She tried
desperately to cut the paper by turning the paper in different angles. In spite
of all efforts when she could not cut she yelled, “Teacher, these scissors won’t
work.” The teacher found her a new pair of scissors and then walked away
feeling her task was done. Seeta tried to cut the paper using both hands on
the scissors. She then put the scissors in her right hand and whacked away
at the paper. After a few minutes of unsuccessfully trying to cut her paper she
dropped the scissors, frowned and in a whiny voice said, “I am done.”
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
44
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:
The child was using the scissors probably for the first time and did not know
how to hold the scissors correctly which was one of the main reasons why
the child could not cut. Secondly, the finer motor development of a three year
old child has not progressed enough to allow the child to cut on paper using
scissors. You would write in detail here.
CONCLUSIONS:
You would conclude in detail here
REFLECTIONS :
In the practicum activity, I observed the preschool stage of human life span.
I tried my best to observe the development characteristics of the preschool
child. It was a good experience and now I understand the limitations of this
stage very well. You would write your experience here.
Note: In this way you have to write about your observations with
respect to the second individual (belonging to a different stage of the
human life span) also in a different setting.
Do remember to make to comparative study of the two sets of
observations as well.

Illustration 1: Assessment of Development of Infant
4.1 INTRODUCTION
Infancy is a period of rapid growth and development. It includes the first two
years of human life span. In this given Practicum activity we will be analysing
the developmental status of two infants at different ages, for example 6 months,
and 1½ years. This Practicum activity will help you in understanding the
physical, motor, cognitive, language, social and emotional development that
occurs across the period of infancy. But before conducting this Practicum
activity, you must have thorough knowledge of developmental milestones during
infancy, given in Unit 12 of Block 3 of Course MCFT – 001.
Objectives
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 examine the physical and motor development of infants;
. explain the social and emotional development of infants; and
 understand and assess the cognitive and language development of an
infant.
4.2 PART-1
Development During Infancy
 Physical and Motor Development
During infancy physical and motor development can be categorised as gross
motor development and fine motor development. Gross motor development
includes movement and control of the large muscles of the body such as that
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
46
of the arms, legs, trunk, head and shoulders that would help the growing child
to keep the head in one place, sit with support and later sit without support
by the age of nine months.
When the infant approach the end of the first year of life they should be able
to walk with, and later without, support. Gross motor development helps
children in attaining bodily control of themselves and also assists the growing
children in exploration of the environment around them.
Fine motor development would include using one’s palm and fingers to grasp
large objects and use the finer grasp to pick up small objects. Mastery of the
eye-hand co-ordination also helps the child to make purposeful hand
movements to perform activities such as self feeding, reaching out for distant
objects etc.
 Socio-Emotional Development
Human beings are social animals. The first sign of social activity is seen in the
new born child. The loud cry of the baby functions to force the new mother
to focus her attention on the new born and respond to the need of hunger or
discomfort. This cycle of interaction and soothing comfort acts as a precursor
for the child to actively seek attention and in the process communicate with
feeling and emotions with the primary caregiver; the infant starts recognising
the sound of the familiar adult. You have also seen the crying baby being
comforted when he or she hears the sound of the caregiver. Infants are able
to smile around 3-4 months and also show fear and anger when disturbed. A
6 months old infant also starts to fear certain objects if negatively reinforced.
An infant of 6 months recognises the mother and actively seeks her company.
The 9 month old infant begins to show stranger anxiety and feels secure only
if the mother is around. If the mother goes aways the child begins to feel
insecure and shows stranger anxiety.
Emotions play an important role in the life of children. They add to the
pleasure of every day experience, serve as a motive of action and determine
finally the characteristic pattern of adjustment to life.
 Cognitive and Language Development
The growth of cognition or intelligence in the infant is reflected in the coordinated
movements of the body and also in increased repertoire of behaviour and
responses in the day-to-day activities.
Language development is a critical aspect in the growth of infant. The infant
learns language initially by listening and when the ability to co-ordinate tongue
and lip movements develops, speech sounds appear. Language development
can be understood as:
i) Pre-language development stage; and
ii) Language development stage.
Understanding Development
during Infancy
47
During the pre-language development stage the infant begins to produce cooing
sounds as ‘coo’. Later these sounds appear as strings of sounds such as
‘papapa’ ‘dadada’, ‘mamama’. It is termed as the babbling stage. After this,
the child begins to produce sounds in the same tone as of adult speech but
using meaningless word sounds. This is termed as idiosyncratic speech. By
the age of one year the child is able to say one word and in the process
attempts to convey meaning and purpose of the utterance through ‘one word’.
Later, the child begins to say two words such as ‘want water’, ‘come mama’,
and so on to convey the message. This is termed as the telegraphic speech.
By two years of age the young child is able to point out and label objects in
his or her surroundings and also ask questions, describe an event in a line and
also informs about events with the acquired language skills. It is at this stage
that the young child also begins to use name of an object to describe objects
that appear similar. For example, a child may begin to call a dog and all other
animals with four legs and a tail as dog. This is termed as over generalization.
On the other hand a child may call an animal a cat which comes to his or her
house but does not call all the other cats by the same word which he sees
on the street. This is referred as underextension.

Activity 1 : Assessment of Development of Infant
AIM:
To assess the development of an infant.
OBJECTIVES:
After undertaking this Practical, you will be able to:
 Examine the physical and motor development of infants;
 Explain the social and emotional development of infants; and
 Understand and assess the cognitive and language development of an
infant.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Physical and motor development checklist, socio-emotional development
checklist, cognitive and language development checklist, pen/pencil, notepad/
papers, ball, crayon, beads, thread, cubes of different colours, cards showing
pictures of animals, colours, household items, different clothes, fruits, vegetables
and toys.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
48
Procedure:
In this practicum activity, you have to identify two infants in the range of birth
to 2 years, with a minimum of 6 months age difference. Select the infants of
different ages like 6 months, 1 year and 2 months or 1 year and 8 months
etc. You have to approach the mother or primary care of the infant, explain
the practicum activity and its purpose and seek the consent to conduct the
practicum activity. Decide the time and day according to their convenience.
Reach the venue on time or 15-20 minutes earlier. Spend a few minutes in
establishing rapport with the caregiven and the child. Allow the child to settle
down in the area specified for taking observations. Allow the caregiver to be
near the child during observations. Let the child get familiar with the
surroundings and the objects before you begin the observations.
It is important that the child is also familiar with you, so extablishing a rapport
with the child is necessary. If this is the first time that you are seeing the child
then spend about 10-15 minutes getting familiar with the child and play with
the child to create a friendly atmosphere. It is advisable to observe the child
for atleast 1½-2 hours to that you can able to record the desirable information.
For the purpose you may observe the infant on more than one occassion;
during more than 1 visits, if required. It would be useful that you speak to
the caregiver about the preferences and nature of the child to be observed so
that you can accordingly act and react to the child’s responses and behaviours.
Do not forget to find out the exact age of the child. When starting to observe
the child, follow the given checklist and put a tick on the behaviours that have
been observed. To observe the desired behaviour of infant, you can change
and modify the settings (with the permission of caregiver). For example, to
check the eye-hand coordination, you may ask the caregiver to give something
to eat, or hold, to the infant. You can take help of the caregiver to give
opportunities to the infant to exhibit behaviours listed in the checklists. For
behaviours (listed in the three checklists) could not be observed during the
period of observation, you may seek the required information from the mother
or primary caregiver of the infants.
Repeat the procedure with another infants of a different age and compare the
findings with respect to the two infants at the end.

Illustration : Understanding Development during Early Childhood
5.1 INTRODUCTION
After infancy the child enters the childhood stage. The childhood stage of human
development is broadly divided into early and middle childhood. Early childhood
stage of human life span is considered to cover the age group of 2 to 6 years.
This period is also called the preschool period, as it is considered as a transition
period of child from home to school. Preschool children are making developmental
progress and express an interest in the world around them. They are enthusiastic
to learn and to gain inner control. They learn by experiencing and by doing. They
are more independent than toddlers. They can express their needs through
meaningful language. In the second practicum activity you have to deal with the
preschool children so to understand this stage better. You will assess the physical
and motor development, cognitive and language development and social and
emotional development of preschool children.
Middle childhood is the stage of human development that occurs after early
childhood stage and normally covers 6 to 11 years age group. The physical,
cognitive, social, emotional and moral development and growth is still on going at
this stage. One can observe the difference in physical appearances of the children
in this age group. This might be because of various factors for example, heredity,
nutrition, culture etc. The Practicum activity deals with the assessment of
developmental status of children in the middle childhood stage. In this, you will
assess the cognitive, social, emotional and moral development of children in middle
childhood years. You have studied about the developmental milestones and domains
of preschool, elementary and middle school children in Units 13 and 14 in Blocks
3 and 4 in Course-1 (MCFT-001). This Practicum activity also provides you an
opportunity to understand the development process in middle childhood years
more comprehensively.

5.2 PART-I
Development During Early Childhood
5.2.1 Physical and Motor Development
Physical and motor development rate slows down in the early childhood years as
compared to infancy. At this stage the body proportions start changing and the
baby looks disappear as neck elongates and chin becomes more pronounced.
The shoulders become broader, chest and abdomen flatten, arms and legs grow
lengthier and hands and feet become bigger. This is an age to learn and acquire
motor skills. Hand skills like self-feeding, self-dressing, brushing teeth and hair
and bathing are acquired. Similarly, leg skills like walking, runing, hopping, skiping,
galloping and jumping can also be seen. Handedness (preference to use left or
right hand, leg, feet, eye etc.) is also an important feature of this stage.
5.2.2 Cognitive and Language Development
According to Piaget, a child during the early childhood period is in the preoperational stage of cognitive development (Please refer to Unit 4 of Block-1 of
MCFT-001). At this stage, the preschool child wants to explore the environment
and is able to answer simple questions. Preschool children ask a lot of questions
like ‘what’, ‘how’, ‘why’ etc. Their questions are imaginative. Vocabulary and
language skills are developing quickly at this stage. Children at this stage are able
to make sentences of 5 to 6 words. They can tell stories, poems and ask questions.
5.2.3 Socio-Emotional Development
Emotions during early childhood years are extreme and shortlived. Preschoolers
start expressing their feelings in words. The preschool children like the company
of other children and enjoy playing with them. They learn to interpret the feelings
of others.
If one observes a 2 to 6 year old, one can find that social development in terms
of play behaviour proceeds in a three step sequence. It begins with non-social
activity – unoccupied, onlooked behaviour and solitary play, then it shifts to a
limited form of social participation called parallel play in which a child plays near
other children with similar materials but does not try to influence their behaviour.
At the higher level the preschooler engages in social interaction play called
associative play in which children engage in separate activity, but they interact
by exchanging toys and connecting with each other’s behaviour. The other kind
of play is cooperative play which is a more advanced type of social interaction
in which children orient towards a common goal such as acting out on make
believe theme or making art work such as house, teacher, sand castle or painting
together.
Development sequence of cognitive play categories are:
i) Functional play – It includes simple repetitive motor actions. For example:
running around a room, rolling a car, kneading clay without intention of
making something.
ii) Constructive play – It includes creating or constructing something and is
especially common between 3 to 6 years of age. For example: making a
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
58
house of toy blocks, drawing a picture, putting together a puzzle.
iii) Make believe play – It includes acting out everyday and imaginary roles,
especially common between 2 to 6 years of age. For example: playing
house, school teacher or police officer, acting out fairy tales or any famous
T.V. character.
5.3 PART-2
Activity : Understanding Development during Early Childhood
AIM:
To assess development during the early childhood years.
OBJECTIVES:
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
1. Examine the physical and motor development during early childhood years;
2. Understand the cognitive and language development during early childhood
years; and
3. Explain social and emotional development during early childhood years.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Physical and motor development checklist, socio-emotional development checklist,
cognitive and language development checklist, pen/pencil, notepad/papers, ball,
crayon, beads, thread, cubes of different colors, cards showing pictures of animals,
colours, actions, household items, different clothes, fruits vegetables and toys.
Procedure:
In this practicum activity, you have to identify at least two children preferably of
different genders in the age group of 2 to 6 years. Select children of different ages
like sample of 2½ and 5½ years etc. You have to approach the mother or primary
caregiver of the child. Explain the practicum activity and its purpose. Seek the
consent to conduct the practicum activity. Decide the time and day according to
their convenience. Reach the venue on time or before 15-20 minutes. Spend
some time in establishing rapport with the child. Allow the child to settle down in
the area specified for taking observations. Allow the caregiver to be near the child
during the observations. Let the child get familiar with the surrounding, and the
objects before you begin with the observations.
It is important that the child is also familiar with you, hence developing a rapport
with the child is necessary. If this is the first time that you are seeing the child then
spend about 10-15 minutes getting familiar with the child and play with the child
to create a friendly atmosphere. It would be useful that you speak to the caregiver about the preferences and nature of the child to be observed so that you
can accordingly act and react to the child’s responses and behaviours. When
starting to observe the child, follow the given checklist and put a tick on the
behaviours that have been observed. You may seek the cooperation of the caregiver
to give the child opportunites to exhibit the behaviours listed in the checklist. For
behaviours which neverthless could not be observed or for which the opportunity

59
could not be provided, you may seck the information from the mother or primary
caregiver of the child.
Repeat the procedure with the second child you observe and compare the two
children at the end.

47. Child speaks truth.
48. Child obeys rules and orders.
49. Child uses words like sorry, please and thank you.
50. Child puts things back at their places after use/ play.
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:
Cognitive and language development: Here the child is unable to judge
similarity or difference in the terms of height and width. He was concentrated
on height but unable to think that how the change has occurred. He was not
able to mentally reversing the action. The child is in preoperational stage and
unable to conserve and reverse the process. The child thinking is animistic
and egocentric……… (In this way you have to interpret the response and
observation of all the three domains under study)
REFLECTION:
The child in early childhood is in the preoperational stage of cognitive
development. It lasts from two to seven years of age. In this stage the child’s
symbolic system expands and use of language develops and perceptual images
move beyond. There are a number of limitations in this stage. During this
stage the child looks at physical change more than social change. In this stage
the child is unable to understand how the various classifications are made. In
this stage the major organising forces are centration and irreversibility.
Centration is narrow concentration on one feature to the exclusion of other
as the subject concentrates on height of the liquid than the narrowness of the
bottle. Irreversibility is inability to reverse the action. In a preoperational
stage the child is unable to do this. The child observed was in his preoperational
stage and his development was age appropriate. She is unable to understand
how the water level changes. She can’t arrange the sticks in their order. Some
times there may be a difference in children’s performance may also be due to
difference in classroom studies and also due to environmental differences….
(In this way you have to write down the conclusion of all the three
domains under study.)

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Middle childhood is the stage of human development that occurs after early
childhood stage and normally covers 6 to 11 years age group. The physical,
cognitive, social, emotional and moral development and growth is still on going at
this stage. One can observe the difference in physical appearances of the children
in this age group. This might be because of various factors for example, heredity,
nutrition, culture etc. The Practicum activity deals with the assessment of
developmental status of children in the middle childhood stage. In this, you will
assess the cognitive, social, emotional and moral development of children in middle
childhood years. You have studied about the developmental milestones and domains
of preschool, elementary and middle school children in Units 13 and 14 in Blocks
3 and 4 in Course-1 (MCFT-001). This Practicum activity also provides you an
opportunity to understand the development process in middle childhood years
more comprehensively.
6.2 PART-1
6.2.1 Physical and Motor Development
The physical development during middle childhood is a bit slow in comparison to
infancy and early childhood. The child loses the baby fat, and experiences changes
in size and muscle strength. The child at this age acquires a wider range of gross
and fine motor skills. The child can now balance the body and other objects more
efficiently as the large muscles are strengthened at this stage. You can observe the
improvement in strength, ability and flexibility among children during 6-12 years
of age, which improves the ability to run, jump and hop, Development of skills
of kicking, dribbling and other physical activities are seen in children 6-12 years
of age.

6.2.2 Cognitive and Language Development
According to Piaget the child is in the concrete operational stage of cognitive
development. You have read this theory, as well as about language development,
in detail in Block 1 of this course. The child is now able to classify objects, seriate
and comerve. Further, children during the middle childhood period outgrow
egocontrism and begin to see things from other people’s perpectives as well.
1. Seriation: It is the ability to arrange objects in order or according to their
increasing or decreasing dimensions.
2. Conservation: It is the ability to understand that property of any substance
remains constant although the appearance of it may be changed. Conservation
is of volume, mass, number, area and weight.
3. Class inclusion: It is the ability to classify or include the objects in a group
which have certain identical characteristics and also to exclude the objects
from a group on the basis of the characteristics that are not common with
the group.
4. Egocentrism: In this children are not be able to understand the other peson’s
perspective and focus on their own view point.
5. Mental representations: It is an internal interpretation of information
representation of an idea, thought or action in the mind.
6. Animism: It is a belief that non-living things have life like qualities similar to
living things.

PROFORMA I: COGNITION DEVELOPMENT DURING
MIDDLE CHILDHOOD
Task 1: Conservation of volume: Show the child 2 similar glasses. Put
water in both the glasses till level become same. Ask the child if both
the glasses have same volume of water. Transfer the water from one glass
to another tall and cylindrical glass. Ask the child, “Which are of the two
glasses now contain more water?”.
Response of the child: The child was shown two similar glasses. Water was
put in both till level was same. When the child said both had equals volume
then the water of one was put in another tall and cylindrical glass and the
child was asked which of the two had more water. The respondent told both
had equal volume of water. The only difference was that the earlier glass
was broad whereas the latter was narrow; so on the transfer, no change in
volume took place.
Task 2: Conservation of mass: Show the child two equal balls of clay.
Ask the child if both the balls same in size (mass). Flatten one ball of clay
and again ask the child, “Which of the two has more mass of clay?”.
Response of the child: The child was shown two equal balls of clay and
after telling him that both were of same mass, one ball was flattened and
asked which ball has more mass. The respondent said both were equal the
only difference was that one was flattened where as the other one was round.

Task 3: Conservation of number: Make two sets of equal numbers of
marvels. One set should be scattered while the other should be piled. Ask the
child, “Which set has a more number of marvels?”.
Response of the child: The child was shown two sets of marvels. One set
was scattered while the other was piled and the child was asked which set
had more number of marvels. He said both were of the same number.
Task 4: Conservation of weight: Show the child two equal balls of clay.
Tell the child that both the balls are of same weight. Now, roll one ball of clay
into a cylindrical shape. Ask the child, “Which of the two has more weight?”.
Response of the child: The child was shown two equal balls of clay and after
telling him that both were of same weight, one ball was rolled and asked the
child which ball was heavier. The respondent said both were of equal weight
the only difference was that one was rolled where as the other one was
round.
Task 5: Seriation: Give the child 7 sticks of unequal sizes and ask her or
him to arrange in order from biggest to smallest.
Response of the child: The child was given 7 sticks of unequal sizes and
asked to arrange in order from biggest to smallest. The child arranged the
sticks in order.
Task 6: Class inclusion: Show the child 5 ball pens and 4 ink pens. Ask
the child, “Which are more pens or ball pens?”.
Response of the child:: The child was shown 5 ball pens and 4 ink pens and
asked which were more, pens or ball pens. The child answered the pens
were more as ball pens were also pens. One had ink while the other had
refill.
Task 7: Animation: Ask the child following questions:
a) If we hit the table will it get hurt?
Response of the child: No
b) If I prick your doll with a needle will it cry?
Response of the child: Yes
c) If I prick your mother with needle will she cry?
Response of the child: Yes
d) Do the clouds move and walk like us?
Response of the child:Yes
Task 8: Ego Centrism: Place a doll at sitting position in the centre of the
table. Place some objects/toys like pen, ball, toy car etc. behind the doll.
Make the child to stand in front of doll. Ask the child following questions:
1. “What can you see?”
Response of the child: Doll, pen, car, ball (he named all the objects that
were placed on table).

2. “What can the doll see?”
Response of the child: She can only see me.
3. “Can doll see all the objects that you are able to see?”
Response of the child: No
PROFORMA II: INFLUENCE OF MASS MEDIA, EDUCATION
AND PEERS
Ask the respondents about her/his views on following:
a) Television
Response of the child: I like viewing television. I watched discovery channel,
and movies on TV. My parents don’t allow me to watch TV more than 2
hours. I don’t like the serials and news channels. I also see cartoon network
and pogo. I find them very entertaining.
Note: In this way you have to note down the respondent’s view on given
items.
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:
The respondent was shown 2 similar glasses. Water was put in both till level
was same. When the respondent said both had equals volume then the water
of one was put in another tall and cylindrical glasses and the respondent
was asked which of the two had more water. The respondent told both had
equal volume of water. The only difference was that the earlier glass was
broad which the latter was narrow, so on the transfer, no change in volume
took place. The respondent here is able to reverse the process and understand
that volume does not change with the change of containers. The respondent
was shown too equal balls of clay and when she \said both were of same
mass then one was flattened and asked which more was. The respondent
said both were equal the only difference was that one was flattened which
the other was round only. Here the respondent has the knowledge of
conservation of mass as she says that there is no change except change in
shape…………….
Note: In this way who have to interpret the whole information you had
noted down in two proformas.
REFLECTION:
The observer found that children in this stage understand their basic logical
rules and are therefore able to reason logically and quantitatively. The
achievement of the concrete operational stage is the ability to engage in
mental operations that are flexible and fully reversible. Children in this stage
move freely from one point of view to another, thus they are able to be
reasonably objective in evaluating events. They are also the decentre that is
to focus their attention on several attributes of an object or event simultaneously
and to understand the relations between dimensions. There is horizontal
ideology that is the tasks are spread over a time as the understanding of
conservation of number takes place by 6 years, of conservation of weight by
9 years and of mass by 7 years. This is clearly seen as the respondent when
asked which of the two glasses had more water. The respondent

acknowledges that the amount of liquid remains the same, that a change in
one dimension says height can be compensated for a change in other direction
is width. Similarly, children understand that the amount of clay in ball doesn’t
change when its shape changed. The child at middle childhood stage is able
to arrange sticks in order. This shows the child’s grasp of transitivity that is
that there are fixed relations among the qualities of objects. A concrete
operational child can reason simultaneously about parts and wholes they
understand that class inclusion indicate the logical principle that there are
hierarchical relations among categories.
The child can realize that more than one category or more than ne
relationships at any chance of time. Although the child has advanced in
reasoning, problem, solving and logic, their thinking is restricted to here
and now of concrete operations. They cannot reasons about abstractions,
hypothetical propositions, or imaginary events.
Note: In the given illustration the Cognitive development of child at
early childhood was concluded on the basis of information gathered from
respondent. In this way, you have to conclude information on other
domains.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Adolescence is termed as a period in the development of the human being when
the growing individual begins to transform into an adult like physical form
accompanied by improvement in the mental faculties. The developmental domains
of the adolescent years are well discussed in Unit 15 “Families with Teenagers”
of Block 4 of Course MCFT-001. It is a pre-requisite for this Practicum activity
that you should have theoretical knowledge of the stage of adolescence. To
understand this stage better, you are required to do a case study on an adolescent
boy or girl.
Objectives:
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Understand parent adolescents relationship;
 Explain sibling and peer relationships of adolescents;
 Understand views of adolescents on a variety of aspects.

7.2 PART-1
7.2.1 Adolescence: A Period of Charm and Challenges
Adolescence has traditionally been considered a more difficult period in
development than the preceding middle childhood years for both adolescents and
their parents. Adolescence is described as a period of great storm and stress. At
the some time adolescents have immense physical, mental and emotional potential.
Nevertheless, adolescents experience a lot of changes that include physical, sexual,
psychological and cognitive changes as well as a change in social needs. They
experience a rapid rate of biological maturation. They are struggling to achieve
identity of their own seaking answers to questions like“Who am I?” “What will
I do/become in future?”
Adolescence is considered as a physiological and psychosocial period during
which most young persons adjust to radical changes in their bodies. It is a difficult
stage of life. On the one hand there is struggle towards maturity and at the same
time it is a period of hopes, new experiences and expanded opportunities for
growth.
Various areas of development during adolescence are discussed below.
 Physical Development
One universal aspect of adolescence is physical growth and maturation. It is
separated from earlier stages of development due to the physiological changes of
puberty that marks its beginning. The term puberty refers to the first phase of
adolescence when sexual maturation becomes evident. It begins with hormonal
increase and their manifestations. Sexual maturation is accompanied by a growth
spurt.
The term ‘growth spurt’ refers to the accelerated growth in height and weight that
occurs with puberty. This increase in growth varies widely in intensity, duration
and age of onset from one child to another. Changes in height and weight are
accompanied by changes in body proportions in both boys and girls.
For the adolescent girl, menstruation is a symbol of sexual maturity and
womanhood. Because young women’s reaction to menstruation may generalise
broadly, it is vital that their initial experience with it be as good as possible. A
majority of girls view menstruation as either negative or neutral. This attitude may
be due to physical discomfort and hormonal influences on mood but it appears
to be largely due to negative social attitudes. Just as the onset of mensturation
may be transmatic adolescent girls, uncontrolled erection and initial ejaculation
may surprise and worry young boys.
 Cognitive Development
Continuing cognitive development, including the advent of the stage of formal
operations, allows adolescents to think more abstractly to formulate and test
hypotheses and consider what might be rather than what merely is. These abilities
often lead adolescents to criticise parental and social values. Egocentric young
people at this stage may conclude that others are preoccupied with their appearance
and behaviour as they themselves are! Adolescents’ cognitive development also
plays an important role in personality development and in formation of a clear
Understanding Adolescence:
A Period of Transition from
Childhood to Adulthood
79
sense of identity. Because of the ability of formal operations, they develop
certain skills like formulating hypotheses, deductive reasoning, integrative ability
and abstract reasoning/logic. The main development is that possibility dominates
reality.
 Social Development
Social development during adolescence includes the following aspects.
1. Relationship with Parents and Siblings
Becoming independent of one’s family is a basic task of adolescence in the
Western view. In the Indian context, however, adolesents do not experience the
need for independence in the same way as it is seen in Western societies.
Interdependence with family is an important value. Yet, questioning and arguing
with parents or any other authority may be quite common.
In India, parents give more freedom and space to boys than girls. Girls are more
confined to home than boys. This conflict among the parental preferences of different roles and responsibilities for boys and girls at times leads to friction among
sibling relationships. The special bond shared bysiblings makes them realise bythe
end of teen years that they can trust, rely and share the most important family and
personal problems with each other.
2. Relationship with Peers
Peers play a vital role in the psychosocial development of most adolescents as
their ties with parents become weaker. Peers provide an opportunity to learn
social skills, to control behaviour and to share similar problems and feelings.
Being accepted by peers generally and having one or two close friends is important.
Friends are likely to be of the same age and sex as well as from similar
backgrounds. Sharing similar values and jokes with friends is common among
adolescents. Contrary to popular opinion, peers are more likely to reinforce
parental values than to oppose them, although there are likely to be generational
differences in tastes, fads and customs.
Many factors affect the likelihood of an adolescent’s acceptance by peers including
intelligence, physical appearance, skills, social status and special talents. Generally
adolescents prefer peers who are cheerful, tolerant, good natured and enthusiastic
individuals who contribute to others by making them feel accepted and involved.
Poor peer relationships during childhood and adolescence are predictive of adult
emotional disorders, delinquency, disturbances in social adjustment and other
forms of maladaptive behaviours.
 Self-concept
A central task of the adolescent is to form a stable sense of identity of which
gender identity is one of the major components in addition to vocational identity.
According to Erik Erikson’s theory, individuals with a strong ego identity see
themselves as distinct and separate individuals and with integrity of needs, motives
and behaviour. Their self-perceptions are reciprocated in the sense that others
perceive them as they perceive themselves. Mature identities are often formed
after a period of searching and uncertainty.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
80
Gender identity is one major component of identity formation. Different individuals
may define different characteristics as part of their gender identity. Androgyny is
a combination of culturally defined masculine and feminine traits. Vocational
identity is central for many adults and young people. Adolescents who work
during adolescence appear slightly better prepared for adult employment.
 Emotional Development
Although most adolescents are basically optimistic about their future, a minority
of them feel alienated from their society. They feel little involvement with people
or with social institutions often viewing them all with distaste. Some appear to
lack the capacity for intimacy and deep interpersonal relationship.
Both social conditions such as poverty and individual experiences contribute to an
adolescent’s tendency to become delinquent. Delinquency is especially high in
deteriorated urban neighbourhoods and areas with little community solidarity. The
personality characteristics that distinguish delinquency include impulsivity.
Adolesents who are delinquents are rated as dishonest, troublesome and unpopular.
Although most adolescents do not go through a period of severe “storm and
stress”, some experience significant psychological problems including acute anxiety,
psychosomatic disorders, depression and sometimes suicide. Suicide may also
be precipitated by an immediate unhappy event but it is usually rooted in longstanding difficulties in coping that leads to feelings of helplessness.
Eating disorders sometimes occur during adolescence. The essence of adolescence
is to develop a coherent sense of personal identity and positive self-esteem, to
become autonomous and socially responsible, to enjoy working and to be capable
of making mature decisions as adults.
7.2.2 Case Study as a Method
Case study is an approach which studies a social unit or setting intensively. The
examples of a social unit or others can be an individual, a family, a situation or
community or even an entire culture. Case studies attempt to study the holistic
character of the unit. This approach involves collecting indepth information
pertaining to the unit under study.
The case study approach can use a variety of data collection methods such as
observations, interviews, questionnaires and content analysis of existing records.
Often it may use more than one method of collecting data.
Following are the advantages of case study method:
1. A great deal of information can be obtained about the unit being studied.
2. This design is well-suited to exploratory research.
3. The case study can be conducted in practically any kind of social setting.
Following are the limitations of case study method:
1. It may require months, years or a lifetime to complete a study.
2. It is difficult to derive general conclusions from the findings of case studies.
3. This approach relies heavily on the integrated ability of the investigation to
use the information obtained, to present the unified interpretation of the unit
being studied.

other utility items. They shared a healthy emotional relationship.

Their healthy relationship is reflected in the manner they share and discuss issues
with each other. The respondent did not seem to be emotionally dependent on her
friends but towards her family.

was able to perform the tasks given to her with ease. She was able to perform
the task on combinations with ease and also was able to think about the various
factors or possibilities that led to the accident, which a child in concrete operations
cannot.

entered the phase of puberty and experiences a regular menstrual cycle. She felt
that she was physically and psychologically old enough to take on the life challenges
and looks for support, advice and help from her family. She believed in doing
sincere and hard work to achieve her goals. She shared a healthy emotional
relationship with her parents and younger sibling. With her friends there exist
differences of opinion which she was unwilling to compromise with and she
believed in a separate identity for herself than them. She did not believe in
agreeing to their actions and beliefs due to peer pressure and stress to gain peer
acceptance. The respondent actively sought her family’s approval and involved
them in most of her actions and decisions. The respondent shared a healthy
relationship with her younger brother by sharing and helping him in daily life. In

8.1 INTRODUCTION
In the previous practical exercises you had conducted activities to understand
the various stages of the life cycle. In this Practical, we will try to understand
the adulthood stage of human life span. The adulthood stage is divided into
two sub-stages these are young adulthood and middle adulthood. In the first
activity. We will examine the issues and challenges the young adults face in
this stage. We will try to understand the changes that the individuals go
through when they step into important phases of their life like career and
marriage. The individual moves from one stage to another and the transition
leads to changes and adjustments. We will also try to discover the changes
and adjustments that an individual has to face during young adulthood.
We will also examine the period of middle adulthood. For convenience the life
span is divided into different stages. Usually the years between 45- 60 are
considered as middle age. Generally, when people reach middle age, they are
in what could be called ‘post parental’ families. As children reach adulthood,
they begin leaving home and make their own living arrangement. This phase
of family life cycle is often described as the ‘launching stage’. The effect of
launching children may involve some degree of upset and conflict but it depends
on several cultural factors. Very often, a midlife familiy is described as an

“empty nest” as grown up children would have become independent and left
home. When families are small and nuclear, the probability of the nest emptying
is greater. Empty next till late was popular only in the Western countries, but
with migration, individualization and establishment of more nuclear units empty
nest phenomen on is occuring in India too. In India where large families were
more common earlier, many middle aged parents would find a ‘large full nest’
rather than an empty one. If there are more children, while the eldest has
reached young adulthood, the youngest may still be of school age. However,
now with families becoming nuclear and smaller, Indian midlife families are
increasingly facing the phenomenon of empty nest. All these concepts and
other issues are given in details in Units 16 and 17 of Course MCFT-001.
In this practicum activity, we will try to understand these issues. We will
discuss the felt expectations and limitations of this stage by the respondents
at this stage of their life span. We will also discuss the job satisfaction levels
in working middle adults.
Objectives
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Explain the developmental tasks in adulthood;
 Understand the challenges faced by adults;
 Explain the felt expectations and limitations of middle adulthood; and
 Assess job satisfaction in working middle aged adults.
8.2 PART-I
8.2.1 Young Adulthood
l Developmental Tasks of Young Adults
Please read Unit 16 to get familiarised with developmental tasks of young
adults.
Briefly developmental tasks of young adults are as follows:
1) To establish one’s autonomy as an individual,
2) To plan a direction for one’s life,
3) To get an appropriate education, training or skill,
4) To experience love and sexual feelings,
5) To be involved in love relationships,
6) To select a marriage partner and get married,
7) To manage additional responsibilities as a spouse and parent.
l Issues during Young Adulthood
Young adults today face tremendous pressure to prove themselves in their
chosen careers. There are familial expectations from young men to become
independent earning members across classes. Such expectations may not be
faced by young women across all classes but they have other stereotypical

104
roles and responsibilities for which they are trained and prepared such as
home management and care of family members. However, today girls desire
to seek jobs and become financially independent. Young women in India have
dual responsibilities of managing home and their jobs. The conventional role
of the women as care takers and home makers is embedded in the psyche
and this means women are expected to be equipped with multi-tasking skills
to manage home and work.
Young adults also learn to love and express their love. Love is considered a
requisite for close friendship, lasting intimacy and marriage. But love feelings
are difficult to evaluate during the young adult years because they tend to be
confused and entangled with maturing sex drives. In a culture where free
interaction between the members of the opposite sex is restricted, it may lead
to suppression of feelings of expressing love. In contemporary society young
people from upper social classes have opportunities for gaining social
experience as well as for dating. Across all social classes, however, most
young adults tend to experience some form of intimate interactions. Marriage
decisions in India are usually taken by the family and this may become a
contesting issue between the parents and their children.
l Families with Young Adults
Families with young adults encounter new possibilities, new problems and
new ways to accomplish the developmental tasks of young adult. The family
supports and encourages the individual to become independent and autonomous
in one’s own right. Parents in mid-adult phase may have to break the patterns
and habits of two decades, as they let their children venture into the world
and establish themselves. The processes of launching start during the earlier
life cycle stages of the family, as children prepare for the decisions that will
shape their future. The families which are in launching stage are marked by
the simultaneous release of the family’s children and the addition of new
members by marriage.
6.2.2 Middle Adulthood
l Developmental Tasks of Middle Adulthood
The developmental tasks in middle adulthood, include changes in the ways of
communication, self-esteem of person, sexual needs during that stage, conflict
resolution and problem solving skills. Adults at middle age have to go through
the following tasks:
1. The balance in separateness and togetherness between the couples in
middle adulthood.
2. Arrangement of physical facilities and resources according to the needs
of family life cycle stage.
3. Planning to meet the financial need of family as launching centre.
4. Redefining and realigning relationships with siblings and other family
members of their own generation.
5. Cultivating and maintaining a social support network.
6. Maintaining open systems of communication between the family members.
Understanding Adulthood:
Achieving Maturity
105
7. Widening the family circle through release of young adult children and
recruitment of young members by marriage.
Family developmental tasks are critical as the family may shift from a household
with children to husband-wife pair and at times even face events such as
divorce. The major family goal is reorganizing of the family into a continuing
unit while releasing matured and maturing young persons into lives of their
own. Inspite of acknowledging the stage when children may leave home,
parents may not be able to adjust to an empty home. Thus we need to focus
on the contracting nature of families today as young adults leave home leading
the family to shrink in size.
l Issues in Middle Adulthood
Middle adulthood is often considered as a major turning point in life. People
become aware of their personal ageing and mortality by this time. Suddenly
one becomes aware of changes in the body and finiteness of time. We have
discussed the old middle adulthood and its issues in Units 16 and 17 of
Course MCFT-001. Let us review the major issues in middle adulthood:
1 Menopause: A significant physiological change that takes place in women
in middle age is menopause when the reproductive function comes to an
end.
2 Empty nest syndrome: You are well aware of empty nest syndrome as
we have discussed this in Unit 17 in detail. Empty nest syndrome affects
the women most, the underlying belief being that women are so wrapped
in their mothering roles, that when children move out of house as adults,
women will suffer a crisis. It is true, however, that living alone without
family support is stressful for both men and women.
3 Sandwich generation: Adults at middle age are called the ‘sandwich
generation’. It is seen in the families where three generations are living
together. The middle generation in the mid-40s are ones who are caught
between the demands of children and older people.
4 Marriage and sexuality: It is seen that marital satisfaction hits the
bottom during middle adulthood because the individuals experience
maximum work and parental responsibilities.
5 Relationship with ageing parents: Due to the dramatic increase in life
expectancy, many middle aged adults end up providing care to older
parents.
l Parenting in Middle Years
Parenting young children can be a challenging task of middle adulthood.
One of the major concerns of parents in middle years is to live up to the
social expectations of successfully launching their children. Let us now
discuss family as a launching centre.
Family as a launching centre
The family with adults at middle adulthood is said to be at the launching
stage; it is the period when children begin to leave home. Some may go
for higher education to college or universities or even for jobs, whereas
others may get married.
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
106
Challenges and emerging issues concerning launching of children
The process of launching starts during the earlier life cycle stages of the
family, as the parents of the young person prepare for decisions that will
shape his/her future. Educational plans are formed or it occurs by default
in the school and high school years; however, the platform to launch
children in colleges or universities can be a challenging task for parents.
The parents could be under pressure at the launching stage as they are
being evaluated on how successful they are as parents through their
children. You have read about this in detail in the Block 4 of MCFT-001.

FINDINGS:
Name of the child: Seeta
Age: 3 years
Time of Observation: 9.00 am.
Date: 25-05-10
Duration of time: 20 minutes
During free play, three year old Seeta came to the table where children were
cutting and pasting pieces of coloured paper. She watched for a while, then
picked up some scissors and a piece of paper and tried to cut it. She tried
desperately to cut the paper by turning the paper in different angles. In spite
of all efforts when she could not cut she yelled, “Teacher, these scissors won’t
work.” The teacher found her a new pair of scissors and then walked away
feeling her task was done. Seeta tried to cut the paper using both hands on
the scissors. She then put the scissors in her right hand and whacked away
at the paper. After a few minutes of unsuccessfully trying to cut her paper she
dropped the scissors, frowned and in a whiny voice said, “I am done.”
ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION:
The child was using the scissors probably for the first time and did not know
how to hold the scissors correctly which was one of the main reasons why
the child could not cut. Secondly, the finer motor development of a three year
old child has not progressed enough to allow the child to cut on paper using
scissors. You would write in detail here.
CONCLUSIONS:
You would conclude in detail here
REFLECTIONS :
In the practicum activity, I observed the preschool stage of human life span.
I tried my best to observe the development characteristics of the preschool
child. It was a good experience and now I understand the limitations of this
stage very well. You would write your experience here.
Note: In this way you have to write about your observations with
respect to the second individual (belonging to a different stage of the
human life span) also in a different setting.
Understanding Adulthood:
Achieving Maturity
111
Do remember to make to comparative study of the two sets of
observations as well.
Interpretation:
In this section, you have to compile all the information and write down the
inference that you draw from collected information. Try to explain the information
under the sub-heading as it is obtained from respondents on different interview
schedules. Analyse the information according to content you have read in Units
–16 and 17 of Course MCFT – 001.
Conclusion:
In this section you have to conclude the whole practicum activity according to the
two domains; it includes one paragraph (in about 250 words) about each domain.
Also write few lines on your experience while performing this practicum activity
and discuss whether you have met the aim of activity or not.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
During old age an individual is often associated with disease, loneliness and
uselessness, but the truth about ageing is that it is a natural and universal process.
Issues during old age are special and unique. In the Indian society, adjustments
of old age are related to problems of health, financial and socio-psychological
aspects.
Objectives
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Explain the leisure time utilization in old age;
 Understand the mental and physical health problems of old persons; and
 Assess life satisfaction during old age.
9.2 PART-1
9.2.1 Issues in Old Age
We have discussed old age and its issues in Units 17 and 18 of Course
MCFT-001. Let us review the major concepts and issues in old age.
Generation: A generation can be defined as a position of ranked descent in a
family lineage. The family roles of children, parents, and grandparents define the
generational position within a family, and denote the potential number of
intergenerational relationships an individual may have
126
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
Cohort: Cohort is a term used to designate a group of people born in the same
time in history “travel” through time together as part of the same age-group.
Thus, both inter-cohort relationships and intergenerational relationships are ways
of viewing how members in different age-groups are related to each other.
Following are the major issues in old age:
 Retirement
 Death of a spouse or near ones
 Grandparenthood
 Generation Gap
 Dealing with illness, disability and death
 Safety and well-being
 Issues of old age need to be viewed from a gender-sensitive perspective.

Illustration 1: Draw Three Generational Family Tree and Genogram
10.1 INTRODUCTION
You have read in Unit 7 of Block 2 of course NCFT-001 about the dynamics
of relationships within the Indian family and the existent diversities in family types
influencing these relationships, such as the joint and the nuclear families. There is
as such no typical family type in India and there are differences even within a joint
or nuclear family. However, we may broadly define a joint family as one constituting
parents, children, grandparents and at times other relations as well. A nuclear
family can be broadly classified as a smaller unit with parents and unmarried
children. Apart from the family type, what is important is also the kinship network
that governs relationships within the Indian context.
Kinship is the relation either through marriage, which is also known as affinity, or
through blood which is termed as descent. Kinship plays an important role in
deciding roles, social groups and categories.
In order to understand the dynamics of relationships and its effect on individual
functioning within specific families, you need to carry out an activity of making a
Family Tree and Genogram. A family tree is basically a chart that represents family
relations in the form of a tree. The family tree helps in understanding the relations
between two generations whereas genogram helps to understand the relationships
shared by individual members within the chosen family in terms of the hereditary
or genetic traits as well as individual personality traits. It is an extended version
of the family tree including emotional ties and the patterns of relationships shared
by the family members. Say for example, a parent may be very strict about
following routines in the family, and this aspect of his or her personality may not
be appreciated by the adolescent, This may probably lead to a rift in their
relationship (this could be a probable explanation; however the complete exercise
should be followed as per the procedure to reach any conclusion). Genograms
can vary significantly because there is no limitation as to what type of data can
be included.
The genogram would help you to identify nuances in the kinship network within
the family as well as outside. It would also help you to understand relationships
138
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
from the perspective of the client. This is the most important part, that is, to
understand what the client thinks about the problem, or whether he or she even
perceives it as a problem; thus, furthering the process of counselling and family
therapy.
Genograms contain abundant information on the families being represented. They
contain basic data found in family trees such as the name, gender, date of birth,
and date of death of each individual. Additional data may include education,
occupation, major life events, chronic illnesses, social behaviours, nature of family
relationships, emotional relationships, and social relationships. Some genograms
also include information on disorders running in the family such as alcoholism,
depression, diseases, alliances, and living situations.
Objectives
After undertaking this Practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Define family tree and genogram;
 Understand the symbols used in genogram; and
 Draw family tree and genogram.
10.2 PART-1
10.2.1 What is a Genogram?
The Indian society is diverse in terms of the family types, family practices as well
as family expectations. The genogram gives an idea about the social and emotional
relationships shared by the individual involved, with all the other members of the
family. At the same time it displays the characteristics of each individual which
might have influenced the person’s current state of mind, or her or his relationships,
along with any hereditary traits that may have instilled the manifested behaviours.
It also gives an idea about significant events that may have occurred in the client’s
life along with persons who may have been a part of that event which would have
created an impact on her or him to affect behaviours.
The Indian family as you would know is hierarchical in structure and multigenerational in nature. The individual does not exist in isolation, but shares a
variety of relationships, such as grandchild and paternal grandparent, grandchild
and maternal grandparent; dada/dadi-pota/poti, nana/nani-dehota/dehoti, great
grandchild and great grandparent (maternal/paternal); pardada/dadi- parpotaparpoti, parent and child, sibling; bhai-behen, aunt/uncle and nephew/niece
(maternal/paternal); chacha/chachi-bhatija/bhatiji, mama/mami-bhanja/bhanji,
bua/fufa-bhatija/bhatiji, masi/masa-bhanja/bhanji/baji, and so on. These are
just examples of close relations. The kinship network is wide and varied and the
degree of relationship would also differ from person to person. To understand the
complexity of relationships the genogram is used. You may ask what is a genogram?
As explained earlier, the genogram could be best described as a family map,
more so a multi-generational family map, wherein the client in the process of
helping you build the map is also equating her or his own relationship with each
member of the family, when he or she makes an effort to describe each member
in terms of their characteristics. The genogram is a pictorial representation on
paper of the client and his or her family, distant as well as immediate relations.
It is a depiction of the relationship shared with each relative in the form of symbols

on paper. The best part is that it is the client’s perspective about individuals, their
characteristics and relationships. This is precisely the first step in understanding
the client in terms of shared relationships, which will further help the therapist with
counselling and family therapy.
In family tree, the older generation is presented at the bottom and as the family
proceeds the tree grows and new generation get its space on branches of the tree.
10.2.2 Symbols used in Genogram
A genogram is similar to a family tree and it goes a little beyond to include the
family history and as stated earlier even an idea about the kind of relations shared
by the client with other members in the family. To begin making a genogram you
must ensure that you have enough practice and are well versed with the various
symbols that are used to denote different persons and the signs to display the
degree of relationship shared. Say for example, a square ( ) represents a man
and a circle ( O ) represents a woman. You can have a list of your own symbols
to signify father, mother, siblings, aunt, uncle, wife, children and so on. Similarly
to represent dates of birth and deaths or any important events symbols may be
devised in advance. Always begin the genogram with the person (client) placing
him/her (self) at the very bottom of the page along with the siblings; keep some
space below to add children if any. Then draw a line connecting all the siblings.
They will all be at the same level in the genogram; the differences will be in terms
of the lines showing the connections between them. For example, if the client is
very close to the sister, then the line connecting the two of them would be dark
and straight ( ) and if the relationship is not too close then a broken or curved
line (~) could be drawn. Decide in advance as to what kind of lines will describe
the strength of each relationship. Include the client’s children (if any) below the
symbol representing the client and any other relations such as ex-husband or wife,
could be shown as an offshoot of the line that links the person with current
relations. Put the client’s parents above the client and her/his siblings; and above
them put the grandparents. Similarly add aunts, uncles and other relations that the
client wishes to talk about. Any other significant relations may be added on.
Once you are done with the description of relatives, begin to put in birth and
death years. In case of divorce or untimely death, put down symbols and the
reasons as well. Say for example, one of the aunts had committed suicide, then
put down the year of her death in her symbol. You could use this information if
you find that the client shared a very close relationship with her. Her untimely
death could have had an impact on the client; the year of death would establish
the age of the client when this episode occurred. As you have already studied in
Block 1, Unit 1 of this course, certain ages are impressionable years and could
leave a long term effect on the person and his/her development. So it becomes
all the more important to delve on this. This was just an example of an event, but
if there are any similar episodes being narrated by the client, then all of those
should be noted.
You have to first have a list of symbols such as suicide (sui or S), birth (B), death
(D) and similar symbols for each detail that you feel would be given by the client.
You can make a list for yourself and use the same anytime you make a genogram
with any client. You also should remember the symbols so as not to distract the
client while making the genogram by shuffling through your papers. It would break
the flow of conversation and at times the client may not even want to repeat some
sensitive information. Individual traits should also be put in, using symbols within
140
Manual for Supervised
Practicum
each member. Say for example the client describes a relative to be highly dominating,
then you could use (do) as the acronym for dominating. This is just an example,
but make sure to have the list ready beforehand. Tape recording may not help as
you may have to go back and forth to associate the same with the diagram. At
the same time the client may not even give consent for the same.

Procedure:
Identify a person, whose three-generation family tree and genogram you will like
to draw. Contact the person, tell him/her the details of your practicum activity and
ask for the information required. It includes the information related to respondent,
his/her parents, parents marriage, respondent’s marriage date, respondent’s children
it may also include the older generation, that is, respondent’s grandparents.
Note down the information on a plain sheet. Then, draw the family tree in given
format or in other creative way. Secondly, draw genogram by using the symbols
you read in Part 1 of this practicum activity.
FINDINGS:
In this section you have to write down each and every detail of the respondent
that you acquired, thereby fulfilling the aim of this practicum activity.
INTERPRETATION:
In this you have to write down your inferences in the following form regarding the
information you acquired about the individual.
I. Family tree
You have to make a three generational family tree of the respondent. You can
use the format provided to you or you can draw family tree by using your
own creativity.
II. Genogram
You have to draw a three generational genogram of a respondent. It also
includes relationship bonding between the family members and other details
like birth, marriage, death etc.

10.4 PART-3
ILLUSTRATION 1: DRAW THREE GENERATIONAL FAMILY
TREE AND GENOGRAM
Here is an example of a genogram that may be referred to before planning
your own activity. Family tree you would be able to draw yourself. This is
an example of a person who is 34 years of age.
AIM: To understand the dynamics of relationships and their effect on individual
functioning with the help of family tree and genogram.
OBJECTIVES:
After undertaking this practicum activity, you will be able to:
 Define family tree and genogram;
 Understand the symbols used in genogram; and
 Draw family tree and genogram.
METHOD:
Materials Required:
Paper, pen, pencil, coloured pens, scale.
Procedure:
I had found Mr. Sood, who is our neighbour, suitable for this practicum activity,
as he is staying with his parents and married and has two daughters. Therefore,
there are three generations living under one roof. I contacted Mr. Sood and took
his consent for this practicum activity. He happily agreed for this after some
discussion on family tree and genogram. He wanted one copy for himself also. I
took an appointment and reached his house at the decided day and time. He was
very co-operative. He told me each and every information I required to draw a
family tree and genogram. He did not want to mention the name of his family
members in practicum file, hence I have changed their names.
FINDINGS:
Mr. Sood belongs to middle income group and is residing in joint family set-up.
He is 34 years old and has his own business. He is living with his parents. His
mother is 60 years old and his father is 63 years old. His mother has retired from
government service as a JBT teacher and his father is still working as contractor.
He is the first child of his parents. He has one younger sister who is 32 years old
and married in 2004. She has one son who was born in 2006. He was also
married in 1999 and had two daughters who were born in 2000 and 2006.
Further, his father has two younger siblings, one is younger brother, born in 1949
and married in 1975 and a sister who was born in 1952 and married in 1970.
His mother also has two elder siblings. His massi (maternal aunt) was born in
1945 and married in 1965 and his mama (maternal uncle) was born in 1947 and
married in 1971. He said his relation to his parental aunt is not very good but he
has strong bonding with his sister. His wife does not have good relation with his
mother.

Interpretation:
Drawing of the Family Tree:
Drawing of the Genogram:
Interpretation of Family Tree and Genogram: The person (whose genogram
is drawn) is denoted by self in the genogram diagram. The genogram depicts that
he is the first child of his parents and has one younger sister. His parents got
married in 1973 and are alive. He is married in the year 1999 and now he is a
father of two daughters of age 9 and 3 years. His sister got married in the year
2004 and has one 3 year old son. The dotted line in the diagram depicts that the
relation between his mother and his wife is not close. Similarly the relation between
him and his paternal aunt (Bua) is not close. (Detailed description is to be given
here.
