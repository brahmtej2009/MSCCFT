Communication is the act of conveying messages/ information from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs, symbols, and semiotic rules.                            *The following figure represents types of communication (Fig 1) Learning objectives of Effective communication 1. 2. Development of Interpersonal Skills To express effectively with maximum efficiency Verbal communication is the use of language to transfer/share information through speaking or sign language. It is one of the most common types, often used during presentations, video conferences, phone calls, meetings and oneon-one conversations. Verbal communication is important because it is efficient. It can be helpful to support verbal communication with both non - verbal and written communication. Non - verbal -Non - verbal communication is the use of body language, gestures and facial expressions to convey information to others. It can be both intentional  or unintentional. Non - verbal communication is helpful when trying to understand others’ thoughts and feelings. Visual communication is the act of using photographs, videos, art, drawings, sketches, charts and graphs to convey information. Visuals are often used as an aid during presentations to provide helpful context alongside written and/or verbal communication.  Sincepeople have different learning styles, visual communication might be more helpful for some to consume ideas and information..  Written communication is the act of writing, typing or printing symbols like letters and numbers to convey information. It is helpful because it provides a record of information for reference. Writing is commonly used to share information through books, pamphlets, blogs, letters, memos, e - mail, SMS and more. Emails and chats are a common form of written communication in the workplace. The major advantages of written communication are listed below: 1. Permanent Record: A written communication helps to maintain a permanent record of the information exchanged or shared. 2.Meticulous Presentation: 1 Communication skills – XI As written document is a permanent record, people are very cautious to fulfil all the writing requisites to make the writing perceivable at the other end. Thus, every document curated covers all major information pointers necessary to be communicated. 3. Easy Circulation: . A written document can easily be circulated in an organisation, unlike the oral communication medium. Thus, this attribute of written communication comes handy in equipping the masses with the necessary information. 4. . Suitable for Statistical Data: Statistical charts and figures are difficult to be interpreted verbally, thus, circulating a document allow people to examine such intrinsic detail with ease. 5..Promotes Goodwill:  When conducting business, a well-crafted written document speaks volumes about the competence of a particular organisation. Therefore, written communication helps to promote goodwill, if performed wisely. Disadvantages of Written Communication: The main disadvantages encountered are: 1.Time consuming: In order to craft an impeccable piece of document, one has to invest an ample amount of time which is indeed difficult in constrained timelines. 2.Non-flexible: A written document cannot be altered once circulated. This makes written communication non-flexible as every written word is concrete and final. 3.No Scope for clarification: If the document is not curated keeping the less informed person’s mindset in check, the details cannot be perceived by such people via the formulated written document. 4.Demands criting proficiency: In order to deliver the message adequately across the other end, one should have competencies in the writing sector. 5.Probability of wrong Interpretation: If there are complex words or difficult sentences included  in the written  document, one may interpret a wrong/no meaning out of it. Thus, in order to use written communication, one should make use ofeasy language.. Advantages of Verbal Communication Skill: 1.It saves time: . The verbal form of communication gives you this facility to quickly send intended message thus saving time.  2.It saves you money, as no printing or arranging of material is involved.  3.Feedback quickness: The distinct advantage of verbal communication is  the fact that the receiver can ask and clarify his doubts on the spot without any delay. The sender can get quick feedback as to whether his intended message is received in its intended form or not and can clarify the receiver, in  case of any doubt. 4.Ease of preparation: Oral communication is the easiest way of communication as it does not require preparation of any material.  5. Most convenient method: Verbal communication is the most widely adopted means of communication globally. People prefer more of verbal communication due to the convenience factor. While communicating verbally, you are more likely to convey matter simply, in plain understandable language which is widely preferred. 2 Communication skills – XI Disadvantages of Verbal Communication: 1.Chances of distortion in meaning: Due to the presence of various barriers in effective communication, it happens that the intended meaning of the message changes for the intended person which causes a lot of problems in the future. 2.Not convenient for long messages: It is not at all convenient to convey long messages orally as it may happen that by the time message is completed, the receiver may forget the previously spoken important points leading to a chance of ineffective communication. As a result, the written format can be used. 3.Irrelevant information: While having an important discussion, a lot of irrelevant information can creep in during a conversation leading to a waste of time and gap in the relevant information. This leads to unnecessary  waste of time and sometimes omitting or forgetting to converse on what is really important. Therefore, it is always necessary to keep your communication process clear of any unwanted discussion that may lead to wastage of your precious time and energy.4. Misunderstanding: Usually, when two individuals are having deep conversations, they can have some misunderstandings during the time. Sometimes subtle hints given or some words spoken with some intention get misinterpreted and a whole new different meaning comes out of it. Thus, it becomes crucial to know that what you have spoken or written has a crystal - clear meaning with no indirect hints that could make a conversation difficult. Advantages of non-verbal communication: 1.Complementary: Non-verbal cues complement a verbal message by adding to its meaning.  2.Easy presentation: Information can be easily presented in non-verbal communication through using visual, audio-visual and silent means of non-verbal communication. 3.Substituting: Non-verbal messages may substitute for the verbal message especially if it is blocked by noise, interruption, long-distance, language barrier etc. For example; gestures-finger to lips to indicate need for quiet, facial expressions- a nod instead of a yes. 4.Reducing wastage of time: The message of non-verbal communication reaches the receiver very fast. Non-verbal cues of communication like sign and symbol can also communicate some messages very quickly than written or oral messages. Disadvantages or limitations of non-verbal communication: Despite of advantages of non-verbal communication, it is not free from its limitations or disadvantages which are: 1.Vague and imprecise: Non-verbal communication is quite vague and imprecise. Since in this communication, there is no use of words or language which expresses clear meaning to the receiver, no dictionary can accurately classify them. Their meaning varies not only by culture and context but by the degree of intention also. 2.Continuous: It is possible to stop talking in verbal communication, but it is generally not possible to stop non -verbal cues. Also, spoken language has a structure that makes it easier to tell when a subject has changed, for instance, or to analyze its grammar. Non - verbal communication does not lend itself to this kind of analysis. 3. While watching someone’s eyes, you may miss something significant in a hand gesture. Everything is happening at once and therefore it may be confusing to keep up with everything. 4.Culture-bound: Non-verbal communication is learned in childhood, passed on to you by your parents and others with whom you associate. A few other gestures seem to be universal. Evidence suggests that humans of all cultures smile when happy and frown when unhappy. However, most non - verbal symbols seem to be even further disconnected from any “essential meaning” than verbal symbols.  5.Long conversations are not possible: In non-verbal communication, long conversation and necessary explanations are not possible.  D0’s and Don’ts of Languageusage 3 Communication skills – XI DO’S                     Use formal language DON’TS Do not use slang, jargon, colloquialisms Use the full verb form instead, e.g. they are, is not, cannot Make more formal vocabulary choices, e.g. have found, a great deal, attractive/ advantageous,  the other, behind issue/problem/notion/idea/topic etc.. Do not use shortened verb forms (contractions), such as they're, isn't, can't. Do not use common vocabulary, such as have got, a lot, nice, the other thing, at the back of. Leave out conversational phrases. Use appropriate connectors and introductory phrases. Do not use conversational opening phrases, such as Well, you see, Yes…, Let's move on. Be non-personal, e.g. It should be possible for everyone to compete. Do not use personal pronouns e.g. I, you, we (unless specifically required), i.e. do not write We think that you should be able to compete. Use complete sentences and link these into logical paragraphs. Do not use bullet points or lists, unless it is in a report. Be objective. Avoid making assumptions or giving your opinion (unless specifically asked). Be clear and concise. Convert questions into statements, for example, The possibility of carbon emissions being reduced is questionable. Avoid waffling or repeating yourself. Do not pose (direct) questions in the running text, that is, do not write, for instance: Can carbon emissions be reduced? Check spelling, grammar and punctuation etc.  Proofread and use a dictionary. Ask somebody to proofread your text.. Do not take for granted that the spell check on your computer is accurate or will spot all spelling mistakes. for example: your spell check will not pick up on whether vs weather.  Also, spell check on US or British English shall be different. Use words(number names)for numbers nine and below and numbers(digits) for 10 and above. Do not mix words and numbers unsystematically.

There are four basic communication styles: passive, aggressive,    passive-aggressive and assertive. It’s important to understand each communication style, and why individuals use them. For example, the assertive communication style has been found to be most effective, because it incorporates the best aspects of all the other styles. PASSIVE Individuals who use the passive communication style often act indifferently, yielding to others. Passive communicators usually fail to express their feelings or needs, allowing others to express themselves. Passive communicators often display a lack of eye contact, poor body posture. Examples of phrases commonly used by passive communicators:  “It really doesn’t matter that much.”  “I just want to keep the peace” Aggressive The aggressive communication style is emphasized by speaking in a loud and demanding voice, maintaining intense eye contact and dominating or controlling others by blaming, intimidating, criticizing, threatening or attacking , among other traits.  Aggressive communicators often issue commands, ask questions rudely, do not give chance for others to speak and fail to listen to others. Examples of phrases that an aggressive communicator would use include:     “I’m right and you’re wrong.” “I’ll get my way no matter what.” “It’s all your fault.” “Just listen to me” Passive-Aggressive 8 Communication skills – XI                 Passive-aggressive communication style users appear passive on the surface, but within he or she may feel powerless or stuck, building up a resentment that leads to seething or acting out in subtle, indirect or secret ways. Most passive-aggressive communicators will mutter to themselves rather than confront a person or issue. Passiveaggressive communicators are most likely to communicate with body language. .Ultimately, passive-aggressive communicators are aware of their needs, but at times struggle to voice them. Examples of phrases that a passive-aggressive communicator would use include:   Assertive “That’s fine with me, but don’t be surprised if someone else gets mad.” “Sure, we can do things your way” (then mutters to self that “your way” is stupid). Assertive communicators can express their own needs, desires, ideas and feelings, while also considering the needs of others. Assertive communicators aim for both sides to win in a situation, balancing one’s rights with the rights of others. Examples of phrases an assertive communicator would use include:    “We are equally entitled to express ourselves respectfully to one another.” “I realize I have choices in my life, and I consider my options.” “I respect the rights of others.” Role play on different communication styles( ACTVITY) OBJECTIVE:  Have fun reflecting on our own communication styles, and consider which can be most effective in bringing our issues forward. HOW: • Role Play ( 3 min) Select a neighbourhood problem the group can relate to (Ex.  Garbage clean up) and practice a short role-play (2 – 3 min) to demonstrate three communication styles.  The players might be: two facilitators and a participant. The aggressive and passive people play the role to an extreme, so that it is so obvious that it is funny.  Their behaviour starts to change when the proactive person demonstrates a more constructive approach. AGGRESSIVE: (wears a very large yellow star) Walks into the scene very confident of his/her ideas, imposing them on everyone else. PASSIVE: (wears a very small yellow star) When expressing his/her ideas can hardly be heard, and allows the aggressive player to dominate. PROACTIVE(type of assertive): (wears a large yellow star) Steps into the scene after  other two have already demonstrated their styles.  He/She listens to  others, clarifies what they are saying, takes a few moments to consider what she/he is hearing and suggests some positive action for them to consider.  • Large group reflection (8 min) Ask:  “What happened?  What were the different ways of addressing the situation?” Note:  Keep the conversation focused on the communication style, not the issue.  Worksheet WHAT IS YOUR COMMUNICATION STYLE?  Directions: Select the answer that describes how do you communicate most often. P = Passive, AG = Aggressive, P/A = Passive Aggressive, and AS = Assertive. Put a tick on one/two of the choices that suit you most. 1. My friends would call me P : shy _________ AG: loud__________ 9 Communication skills – XI P/A: sarcastic_______ AS: confident _______ 2. I usually: P: don’t share my opinions even though I have them._______ AG: share my opinions in a demanding way._______ P/A: have opinions but don’t share them and then become angry towards everyone involved.________ AS: have opinions and share them with others while being open and respectful to the opinions of others. 3. I feel: P: that the opinions of others matter more than my own.____________ AG: that my opinions matter more than the opinions of others.___________ P/A: that I will follow the opinions and ideas of others but talk badly about them behind their backs._____________ AS: that my needs are important and so are the needs of others._______________ 4. When walking into a crowded room: P: I want to hide my face._______ AG: I don’t mind pushing my way through the crowd.__________ P/A: I may push someone out of my way and then blame it on someone else._________ AS: I smile and say “hi” to others and respect other people’s space.___________ 5. I often: P: ignore problems.__________ AG: cause problems___________ P/A: hide problems._____________ AS: solve problems.____________ Many people mistakenly confuse aggressiveness with assertiveness, which is not true. Aggressiveness is behaving in a hostile way. Assertiveness is standing up for your right to be treated fairly and/or advocating for yourself in a clear, direct, and honest way that is positive and proactive. It is expressing your opinions, needsand feelings, without ignoring or hurting the opinions, needsand feelings of others. Assertiveness is actually one of the most positive skill sets you can use and develop for lifelong success. Select the Assertive Communication method from the choices and see if you can identify the other methods of communication as you read through the choices. In class: A. I’m too afraid to raise my hand even though I know the answer._________ B. I shout the answer because I always know them and no one else ever does. C. I know the answer but never participate and then get angry at other people who do. D. I raise my hand when I know the answer and give others the opportunity to do the same. 2. You got a bad grade on a test and you’re not sure why. What do you do? A. You ask the teacher to talk after class. You respectfully explain your confusion about your grade and ask what you can do differently next time. B You don’t say anything but you talk badly about the teacher behind his/her back. 10 Communication skills – XI C. You don’t say anything. It’s not a big deal. 3. Someone cuts(barges) in front of you in line… A. Say nothing, but glare at them and "accidentally" push them a little. B. Say nothing and do nothing. C. Assume they didn't know you were in line; gently explain that you were waiting before them.  D. Yell at them and shout for them to return to their place. Continue using the Assertive Communication method, answer these next set of questions. Write in your actual response to the situation in the space provided: a) There was a test in one of your classes on a day that you were absent. You were legitimately sick, but don’t have a doctor’s note. The teacher tells you that since you don’t have a note, you are not allowed to write the test which jeopardizes your entire credit. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________ b) A friend wants to go for a movie, however you want to go and see something different. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________ What is Writing? Writing is a form of communication that allows students to put their feelings and ideas on paper, to organize their knowledge and beliefs into convincing arguments, and to convey meaning through well-constructed text. In its most advanced form, written expression can be as vivid as a work of art.                                   1. Sentences. The main focus here is to improve basic sentence composition skills. One can review the types of sentences and the functions of their component parts listed below. Simple, compound, and complex sentences a)  Simple sentence- A simple sentence is one independent clause that has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. Notice that there are some important requirements for a simple sentence:      Must have a subject and a verb. Must express a complete thought. Must only have one clause. Examples I am out of paper for the printer. Will you help me with the math homework? b) Compound Sentence A compound sentence allows us to share a lot of information by combining two or more related thoughts into one sentence. It combines two independent clauses by using a conjunction like “and.” This creates sentences that are more useful than writing many sentences with separate thoughts. Example of Compound Sentences 11 Communication skills – XI We use compound sentences quite often. . Here are some examples, the  independent clause is green, the second is purple, and the conjunctions are    orange: 1.I drove to the office, and then I walked to the cabin.  c) Complex sentence  A complex sentence is a sentence that combines one independent clause with at least one dependent clause. Example   Although Rohan had some doubts, he found the courses very useful. The above example is a complex sentence: it has a dependent clause (a subject ' Rohan' and a verb 'had'), followed by an independent clause (subject 'he' and a verb 'found') and forms a complete thought.  Computers have come a long way since they first came in  the market. This example begins with an independent clause (subject 'computers' and verb 'have come') that forms a complete thought, followed by a dependent clause (subject 'they' and a verb 'came'). https://study.com/academy/lesson/types-of-sentences-simple-compound-complex.html#lesson The link mentioned above will further help the students to strengthen their concept on the above-mentioned topics. Writing skills This activity simulates ‘chatting’ – a popular (online) communication  can be used in the language-learning classroom for students who still find it too difficult to write without first having a little ‘thinking’ time, and also as a means of moving students away from being overly concerned with accuracy, and focussing more on successful communication. The students really enjoy this activity, especially the fact of being ‘allowed’ to write notes in the class. The students will need one piece of paper for writing  simple sentences. To encourage students to write brief messages each time, this could be in the form of a ‘chatting page. ( The activity will be done in pairs) Chat sheet Student A     Student B  Student A  Student B  12 Communication skills – XI 13 Communication skills – XI   A suitable subject for the students to ‘chat’ about is chosen such as: ‘Discuss your favourite sports’. Subjects requiring students to reach a solution are particularly effective, for example: ‘Arrange to meet up a client at the weekend and decide what you are going to build up business.  It will be explained to students that in order to communicate, they write a message on the first line of their paper, say ‘Hi, how are you?’, and ‘send’ it over their shoulder to their partner, who will respond and pass the paper back as quickly as possible. This activity will help them to engage themselves in conversations and communicate better.       A worksheet can be taken up in the class to test the concept clarity.                                                                    Worksheet Choose your answers to the questionsbelow. .    Do as directed a) How many clauses appear in the sentence below?      When he woke up that morning, Joseph wondered about his chances at getting the job, but he shrugged off any doubts.        i)Two        ii)Three        iii)One       iv)Five        v)Four b) Which of the following sentences has an INCORRECT subject-verb agreement? i)Subject-verb agreement usually gets trickier as sentences expand into more complex structures. ii)It's amazing that there are never any leftovers in my house after the Super Bowl game. iii)The thought of all the home repairs we need after the bathrooms flooded are daunting. iv)Any book about space visits from vampire Martian aliens is my idea of a good weekend read. c) Which of the following pronouns must ALWAYS be paired with a plural verb?  i)Few, many, both, others, and several. ii) Most, any, none, some, and all. iii) Politics, gymnastics, mathematics, and news. iv) Whomever, whichever, they, and themselves.  (d) Silence is golden when you can't think of a good answer.' - Muhammad Ali In this famous quote, which choice best describes the second part of the sentence 'when you can't think of a good answer?' i)Compound sentence ii) Simple sentence  iii)Dependent clause iv)Complex sentence  v) Independent clause        e) What is wrong with the following sentence?  Clint didn't talk much he just stared you down with cold, dead eyes. i) It has a comma splice. ii)It is a sentence fragment. iii) It is a regular run-on sentence. iv) He' should be capitalized. 2.Phrases - Phrases are a group of words that work together to communicate an element of speech. Types of phrases   1.Noun Phrase A noun phrase is any noun or pronoun along with its modifiers.Example –    2. Verb Phrase The school children Yesterday’s newspaper A verb phrase is any number of verbs working together. Example    3. Prepositional Phrase Had been sleeping Will contact May have written A prepositional phrase always starts with a preposition and ends with a noun or pronoun (and its modifiers) that is called the object of the preposition. Example  Through the wheat field Here, the preposition: through Object of the preposition: the wheat field Some more examples of prepositional phrases:   During the year Despite complaints 4. Verbal Phrases There are three types of verbal phrases: participial phrases, gerund phrases, and infinitive phrases. Each is explained below. a) Participial Phrase 14 Communication skills – XI Participial phrases start with either a present or past participle. Here are some examples of each. Phrase with present participles:  Watching silently Phrases with past participles:  Driven to succeed b) Gerund Phrase A gerund phrase is a present participle (and its modifiers) that acts like a noun. It can take on a variety of jobs in the sentence. Here are a couple of examples:   c) Practicing helped a lot. (subject) I love reading. (direct object) Infinitive Phrase An infinitive phrase is a group of words that uses infinitive and its modifiers. Example   To sing To walk all that way 5. Appositive Phrase An appositive phrase is a phrase that renames an earlier noun or pronoun My best friend, Nick Palacio, loves scuba diving. We watched Sirius, the brightest star in the sky d) 6.Absolute Phrase Absolute phrases are the trickiest to identify. These phrases are not closely connected to rest of the sentence; they don’t describe a specific word, but modify the whole sentence. They add extra information and are usually separated by commas (or dashes). Example The semester finished, Karen sold all her textbooks. Absolute phrase: The semester finished A worksheet can be taken up in the class to further build the  concept. For each sentence, Identify the phrase in bold font. 1.I wish the university that I attend would have an annual kite flying festival in spring time. 2.

Writing Skills  (Consumer power) We are all to some extent consumers, so this is a subject that students of all nationalities and ages should be able to identify with. Activity - Consumer quandary cards 16 Communication skills – XI A hypothetical situation will be given to students related to present day scenario and they will be asked to present/write their views on the same.

What do you do? Do you still want a pair of these trainers for your birthday? Kinds of sentences In writing and speaking, there are four basic kinds of sentences:     a) Declarative sentences Interrogative sentences Imperative sentences Exclamatory sentences A declarative sentence is the most basic type of sentence. Its purpose is to relay information, and it is punctuated with a period. For example:I walked home. b) Interrogative sentences interrogate, or ask questions. These are direct questions, and they are punctuated with a question mark. For example:  c) Why haven’t you completed your work? Exclamatory sentences are like declarative sentences in that they make a statement instead of asking a question, but their main purpose is to express strong emotion. They are easily recognized because they end in an exclamation point instead of a period: For example  Wow, he just got an appraisal! d) Imperative sentences do not simply state a fact but rather tell someone to do something. These can be in the form of friendly advice, basic instructions or more forceful commands. For example:  Turn left at the bridge.
